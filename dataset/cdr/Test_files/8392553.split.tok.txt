Protective effect of clentiazem against epinephrine - induced cardiac injury in rats .
We investigated the effects of clentiazem , a 1 , 5 - benzothiazepine calcium antagonist , on epinephrine - induced cardiomyopathy in rats .
With 2 - week chronic epinephrine infusion , 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days , and severe ischemic lesions and fibrosis of the left ventricles were observed .
In epinephrine - treated rats , left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced , but responses to calcium were normal or enhanced compared to controls .
Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls .
Treatment with clentiazem prevented epinephrine - induced death ( P < . 05 ) , and attenuated the ventricular ischemic lesions and fibrosis , in a dose - dependent manner .
Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with clentiazem alone , but combined with epinephrine , clentiazem restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to isoproterenol .
On the other hand clentiazem did not prevent epinephrine - induced down - regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors .
Interestingly , clentiazem , infused alone , resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle .
Clentiazem also did not prevent the enhanced responses to calcium seen in the epinephrine - treated animals , although the high dose of clentiazem partially attenuated the maximal response to calcium compared to epinephrine - treated animals .
In conclusion , clentiazem attenuated epinephrine - induced cardiac injury , possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway .
