Aconitine - induced Ca2 + overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats .
Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants .
Emerging evidence indicates that voltage - dependent Na ( + ) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine .
However , no reports are available on the role of Ca ( 2 + ) in aconitine poisoning .
In this study , we explored the importance of pathological Ca ( 2 + ) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo .
We found that Ca ( 2 + ) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats .
To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury , we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVMs ) , as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats .
The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose - dependently .
To confirm the pro - apoptotic effects , we performed flow cytometric detection , cardiac histology , transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP - biotin nick end labeling assay .
The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time - dependently .
The expression analysis of Ca ( 2 + ) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca ( 2 + ) overload through the expression regulation of Ca ( 2 + ) handling proteins .
The expression analysis of apoptosis - related proteins revealed that pro - apoptotic protein expression was upregulated , and anti - apoptotic protein BCL - 2 expression was downregulated .
Furthermore , increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members , especially the P - P38 / P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues .
Hence , our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca ( 2 + ) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen - activated protein kinase .
