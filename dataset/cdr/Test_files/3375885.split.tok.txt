Hyperkalemia induced by indomethacin and naproxen and reversed by fludrocortisone .
We have described a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis and a history of mefenamic acid nephropathy in whom hyperkalemia and inappropriate hypoaldosteronism were caused by both indomethacin and naproxen , without major decline in renal function .
It is likely that preexisting renal disease predisposed this patient to type IV renal tubular acidosis with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors .
Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug therapy , fludrocortisone was added , correcting the hyperkalemia and allowing indomethacin therapy to be continued safely .
