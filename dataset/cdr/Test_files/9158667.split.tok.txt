Thrombotic complications in acute promyelocytic leukemia during all - trans - retinoic acid therapy .
A case of acute renal failure , due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) treated with all - trans - retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and tranexamic acid has been described recently .
We report a case of acute renal failure in an APL patient treated with ATRA alone .
This case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with ATRA therapy in APL patients .
The patients , a 43 - year - old man , presented all the signs and symptoms of APL and was included in a treatment protocol with ATRA .
After 10 days of treatment , he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of APL was achieved and therapy discontinued .
We conclude that ATRA is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with APL , although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected .
Thrombotic events , however , could be avoided by using low - dose heparin .
