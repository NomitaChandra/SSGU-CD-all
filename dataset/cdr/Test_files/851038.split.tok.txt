Kaliuretic effect of L - dopa treatment in parkinsonian patients .
Hypokalemia , sometimes severe , was observed in some L - dopa - treated parkinsonian patients .
The influence of L - dopa on the renal excretion of potassium was studied in 3 patients with hypokalemia and in 5 normokalemic patients by determination of renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate , plasma concentration of potassium and sodium as well as urinary excretion of potassium , sodium and aldosterone .
L - Dopa intake was found to cause an increased excretion of potassium , and sometimes also of sodium , in the hypokalemic but not in the normokalemic patients .
This effect on the renal function could be prohibited by the administration of a peripheral dopa decarbodylase inhibitor .
It is not known why this effect occurred in some individuals but not in others , but our results indicate a correlation between aldosterone production and this renal effect of L - dopa .
