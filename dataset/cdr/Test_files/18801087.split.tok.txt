Amiodarone - related pulmonary mass and unique membranous glomerulonephritis in a patient with valvular heart disease : Diagnostic pitfall and new findings .
Amiodarone is an anti - arrhythmic drug for life - threatening tachycardia , but various adverse effects have been reported .
Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease , in a patient who developed a lung mass ( 1 . 5 cm in diameter ) and proteinuria ( 2 . 76 g / day ) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time .
The lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography , but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra - alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies , indicating that it was an amiodarone - related lesion .
In addition , the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition , and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass .
In the kidneys , glomeruli had membrane spikes , prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits , which were sometimes large and hump - like .
Autoimmune diseases , viral hepatitis , malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found .
The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone - related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically , and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment .
