Early paracentral visual field loss in patients taking hydroxychloroquine .
OBJECTIVE : To review the natural history and ocular and systemic adverse effects of patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate who attended an ophthalmic screening program .
DESIGN : Retrospective study .
RESULTS : Records of 262 patients who were taking hydroxychloroquine and screened in the Department of Ophthalmology were reviewed .
Of the 262 patients , 14 ( 18 % ) of 76 who had stopped treatment at the time of the study experienced documented adverse effects .
Systemic adverse effects occurred in 8 patients ( 10 . 5 % ) and ocular adverse effects , in 5 ( 6 . 5 % ) .
Thirty - five patients ( 13 . 4 % ) had visual field abnormalities , which were attributed to hydroxychloroquine treatment in 4 patients ( 1 . 5 % ) .
Three of the 4 patients were taking less than 6 . 5 mg / kg per day and all patients had normal renal and liver function test results .
CONCLUSIONS : The current study used a protocol of visual acuity and color vision assessment , funduscopy , and Humphrey 10 - 2 visual field testing and shows that visual field defects appeared before any corresponding changes in any other tested clinical parameters ; the defects were reproducible and the test parameters were reliable .
Patients taking hydroxychloroquine can demonstrate a toxic reaction in the retina despite the absence of known risk factors .
Screening , including Humphrey 10 - 2 visual field assessment , is recommended 2 years after the initial baseline and yearly thereafter .
