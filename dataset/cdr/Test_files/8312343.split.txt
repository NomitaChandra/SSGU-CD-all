Pediatric heart transplantation without chronic maintenance steroids.
From 1986 to February 1993, 40 children aged 2 months to 18 years (average age 10.4 +/- 5.8 years) underwent heart transplantation.
Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (52%), congenital heart disease (35%) with and without prior repair (71% and 29%, respectively), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5%), valvular heart disease (3%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (5%).
Patients were managed with cyclosporine and azathioprine.
No prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin was used.
Steroids were given to 39% of patients for refractory rejection, but weaning was always attempted and generally successful (64%).
Five patients (14%) received maintenance steroids.
Four patients died in the perioperative period and one died 4 months later.
There have been no deaths related to rejection or infection.
Average follow-up was 36 +/- 19 months (range 1 to 65 months).
Cumulative survival is 88% at 5 years.
In patients less than 7 years of age, rejection was monitored noninvasively.
In the first postoperative month, 89% of patients were treated for rejection.
Freedom from serious infections was 83% at 1 month and 65% at 1 year.
Cytomegalovirus infections were treated successfully with ganciclovir in 11 patients.
No impairment of growth was observed in children who underwent transplantation compared with a control population.
Twenty-one patients (60%) have undergone annual catheterizations and no sign of graft atherosclerosis has been observed.
Seizures occurred in five patients (14%) and hypertension was treated in 10 patients (28%).
No patient was disabled and no lymphoproliferative disorder was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).
