Increased vulnerability to 6 - hydroxydopamine lesion and reduced development of dyskinesias in mice lacking CB1 cannabinoid receptors .
Motor impairment , dopamine ( DA ) neuronal activity and proenkephalin ( PENK ) gene expression in the caudate - putamen ( CPu ) were measured in 6 - OHDA - lesioned and treated ( L - DOPA + benserazide ) CB1 KO and WT mice .
A lesion induced by 6 - OHDA produced more severe motor deterioration in CB1 KO mice accompanied by more loss of DA neurons and increased PENK gene expression in the CPu .
Oxidative / nitrosative and neuroinflammatory parameters were estimated in the CPu and cingulate cortex ( Cg ) .
CB1 KO mice exhibited higher MDA levels and iNOS protein expression in the CPu and Cg compared to WT mice .
Treatment with L - DOPA + benserazide ( 12 weeks ) resulted in less severe dyskinesias in CB1 KO than in WT mice .
The results revealed that the lack of cannabinoid CB1 receptors increased the severity of motor impairment and DA lesion , and reduced L - DOPA - induced dyskinesias .
These results suggest that activation of CB1 receptors offers neuroprotection against dopaminergic lesion and the development of L - DOPA - induced dyskinesias .
