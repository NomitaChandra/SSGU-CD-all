Effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans .
BACKGROUND : In dogs , a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular ( LV ) systolic function and an increase in LV end - diastolic pressure .
This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans .
METHODS AND RESULTS : In 20 patients ( 14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years ) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain , we measured heart rate , systemic arterial pressure , LV pressure and its first derivative ( dP / dt ) , and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15 - minute intracoronary infusion of saline ( n = 10 , control subjects ) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg / min ( n = 10 ) .
No variable changed with saline .
With cocaine , the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3 . 0 + / - 0 . 4 ( mean + / - SD ) mg / L , similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication .
Cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate , LV dP / dt ( positive or negative ) , or LV end - diastolic volume , but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures , LV end - diastolic pressure , and LV end - systolic volume , as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction .
CONCLUSIONS : In humans , the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance .
