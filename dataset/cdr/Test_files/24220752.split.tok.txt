Incidence of contrast - induced nephropathy in hospitalised patients with cancer .
OBJECTIVES : To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to contrast - induced nephropathy ( CIN ) in hospitalised patients with cancer .
METHODS : Ninety adult patients were enrolled .
Patients with risk factors for acute renal failure were excluded .
Blood samples were examined the day before contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( CT ) and serially for 3 days thereafter .
CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine ( Cr ) of 0 . 5 mg / dl or more , or elevation of Cr to 25 % over baseline .
Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated .
RESULTS : CIN was detected in 18 / 90 ( 20 % ) patients .
CIN developed in 25 . 5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not ( P = 0 . 1 ) .
CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy ( P = 0 . 005 ) ; it was also an independent risk factor ( P = 0 . 017 ) .
CIN was significantly more after treatment with bevacizumab / irinotecan ( P = 0 . 021 ) and in patients with hypertension ( P = 0 . 044 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The incidence of CIN after CT in hospitalised oncological patients was 20 % .
CIN developed 4 . 5 - times more frequently in patients with cancer who had undergone recent chemotherapy .
Hypertension and the combination of bevacizumab / irinotecan may be additional risk factors for CIN development .
KEY POINTS : . Contrast - induced nephropathy ( CIN ) is a concern for oncological patients undergoing CT .
.
CIN occurs more often when CT is performed < 45 days after chemotherapy .
.
Hypertension and treatment with bevacizumab appear to be additional risk factors .
