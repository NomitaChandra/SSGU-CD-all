Dose - dependent neurotoxicity of high - dose busulfan in children : a clinical and pharmacological study .
Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans , but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children .
We report here a retrospective study of 123 children ( median age , 6 . 5 years ) receiving high - dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors , brain tumors excluded .
Busulfan was given p . o . , every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days .
Two total doses were consecutively used : 16 mg / kg , then 600 mg / m2 .
The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients ( 16 to 28 mg / kg ) .
Ninety - six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis ; 7 ( 7 . 5 % ) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing .
When the total busulfan dose was taken into account , there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg / kg ( 1 of 57 , 1 . 7 % ) and patients under 600 mg / m2 ( 6 of 39 , 15 . 4 % ) ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
Twenty - seven patients were given a 600 - mg / m2 busulfan total dose with continuous i . v .
infusion of clonazepam ; none had any neurological symptoms .
Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic - mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg / m2 busulfan with clonazepam : busulfan cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio was 1 . 39 .
This was significantly different ( P less than 0 . 02 ) from the cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16 - mg / kg total dose of busulfan .
This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose - dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam .
A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area , resulting in higher doses in young children , was followed by increased neurotoxicity , close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults .
Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16 - mg / kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects .
The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies .
