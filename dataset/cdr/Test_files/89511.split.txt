Prevention and treatment of endometrial disease in climacteric women receiving oestrogen therapy.
The treatment regimens are described in 74 patients with endometrial disease among 850 climacteric women receiving oestrogen therapy.
Cystic hyperplasia was associated with unopposed oestrogen therapy without progestagen.
Two courses of 21 days of 5 mg norethisterone daily caused reversion to normal in all 57 cases of cystic hyperplasia and 6 of the 8 cases of atypical hyperplasia.
4 cases of endometrial carcinoma referred from elsewhere demonstrated the problems of inappropriate and unsupervised unopposed oestrogen therapy and the difficulty in distinguishing severe hyperplasia from malignancy.
Cyclical low-dose oestrogen therapy with 7--13 days of progestagen does not seem to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.
