Intramuscular hepatitis B immune globulin combined with lamivudine in prevention of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation .
BACKGROUND : Combined hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIg ) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients .
This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) .
METHODS : A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients ( 43 men and 8 women ) transplanted for benign HBV - related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months .
HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter .
RESULTS : At a median follow - up of 14 . 1 months , the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3 . 9 % ( 2 / 51 ) .
The overall patient survival was 88 . 3 % , and 82 . 4 % after 1 and 2 years , respectively .
A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57 . 1 % ( 4 / 7 ) and 62 . 5 % ( 5 / 8 ) of HBV - DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative .
Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients .
CONCLUSION : Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation .
