Spectrum of adverse events after generic HAART in southern Indian HIV - infected patients .
To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long - term , fixed - dose , generic highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) use among HIV - infected individuals in South India , we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV - infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India .
The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine ( NVP ) ( 54 . 8 % ) , zidovudine ( AZT ) + 3TC + NVP ( 14 . 5 % ) , 3TC + d4T + efavirenz ( EFV ) ( 20 . 1 % ) , and AZT + 3TC + EFV ( 5 . 4 % ) .
The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash ( 15 . 2 % ; CD4 , 285 cells / microL ) and peripheral neuropathy ( 9 . 0 % and 348 cells / microL ) .
Clinically significant anemia ( hemoglobin < 7 g / dL ) was observed in 5 . 4 % of patients ( CD4 , 165 cells / microL ) and hepatitis ( clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal ) in 3 . 5 % of patients ( CD4 , 260 cells / microL ) .
Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis , while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Among the patients with 1 year of follow - up , NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART .
Frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available .
