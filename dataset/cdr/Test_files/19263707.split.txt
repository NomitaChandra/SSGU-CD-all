Carbimazole induced ANCA positive vasculitis.
Anti-thyroid drugs, like carbimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hyperthyroidism.
One should be aware of the side effects of antithyroid medications.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)--associated vasculitis is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of antithyroidmedications.
We report a patient with Graves' disease who developed ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis.
The episode was characterized by a vasculitic skin rash associated with large joint arthritis, pyrexia and parotiditis but no renal or pulmonary involvement.
He was referred to us for neurological evaluation because he had difficulty in getting up from squatting position and was suspected to have myositis.
Carbimazole and methimazole have a lower incidence of reported ANCA positive side effects than PUT.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis case reported from India.
