Phase II study of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix .
BACKGROUND : The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma .
METHODS : The combination of carboplatin ( area under the concentration curve [ AUC ] , 5 ) and liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ; starting dose , 40 mg / m ( 2 ) ) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile .
RESULTS : Twenty - nine patients were assessable for response , and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity .
The overall response rate was 38 % , the median time to response was 10 weeks , the median duration of response was 26 weeks , and the median survival was 37 weeks .
The main toxic effect was myelosuppression , with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients , anemia in 12 patients , thrombocytopenia in 11 patients , and neutropenic fever in 3 patients .
Four patients had five infusion - related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin , leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients .
Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic toxicity included nausea in 17 patients , emesis in 14 patients , fatigue in 9 patients , mucositis and / or stomatitis in 8 patients , constipation in 6 patients , weight loss in 5 patients , hand - foot syndrome in 2 patients , and skin reactions in 3 patients .
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin has modest activity in patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma .
