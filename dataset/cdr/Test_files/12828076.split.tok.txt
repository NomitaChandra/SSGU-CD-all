Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .
BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .
The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .
METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .
Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .
RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .
There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .
A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .
