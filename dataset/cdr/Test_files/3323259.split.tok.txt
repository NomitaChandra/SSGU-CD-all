Differential effects of 1 , 4 - dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers : therapeutic implications .
Increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases .
The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities .
Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity .
In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem , which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle , the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue .
As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States , nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function .
Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy .
Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule , which encourages patient compliance in long - term therapy of hypertension .
The coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina .
Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage , migraine headache , dementia , and stroke .
In general , the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated , with headache , facial flushing , palpitations , edema , nausea , anorexia , and dizziness being the more common adverse effects .
