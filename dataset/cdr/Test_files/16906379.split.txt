Minocycline-induced vasculitis fulfilling the criteria of polyarteritis nodosa.
A 47-year-old man who had been taking minocycline for palmoplantar pustulosis developed fever, myalgias, polyneuropathy, and testicular pain, with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).
Neither myeloperoxidase- nor proteinase-3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was positive.
These manifestations met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa.
Stopping minocycline led to amelioration of symptoms and normalization of CRP level.
To our knowledge, this is the second case of minocycline-induced vasculitis satisfying the criteria.
Differential diagnosis for drug-induced disease is invaluable even for patients with classical polyarteritis nodosa.
