Pupillary changes associated with the development of stimulant - induced mania : a case report .
A 30 - year - old cocaine - dependent man who was a subject in a study evaluating the anticraving efficacy of the stimulant medication diethylpropion ( DEP ) became manic during his second week on the study drug .
Pupillometric changes while on DEP , especially changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation , were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become manic .
The large changes in total power of pupillary oscillation occurred a few days before the patient became fully manic .
Such medication - associated changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation might be of utility in identifying persons at risk for manic - like adverse effects during the medical use of psychomotor stimulants or sympathomimetic agents .
