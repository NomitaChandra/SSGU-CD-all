Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy in unresectable glioblastoma : a phase 2 study .
Improving glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) treatment with radio - chemotherapy remains a challenge .
Topotecan is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human glioma as well as brain penetration .
The present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy ( 60 Gy / 30 fractions / 40 days ) and topotecan ( 0 . 9 mg / m ( 2 ) / day on days 1 - 5 on weeks 1 , 3 and 5 ) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated GBM .
The incidence of non - hematological toxicities was low and grade 3 - 4 hematological toxicities were reported in 20 patients ( mainly lymphopenia and neutropenia ) .
Partial response and stabilization rates were 2 % and 32 % , respectively , with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks .
One - year overall survival ( OS ) rate was 42 % , with a median OS of 40 weeks .
Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy was well tolerated .
However , while response and stabilization concerned one - third of the patients , the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival in patients with unresectable GBM .
