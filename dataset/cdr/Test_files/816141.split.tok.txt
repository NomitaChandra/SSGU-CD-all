Cephalothin - induced immune hemolytic anemia .
A patient with renal disease developed Coombs - positive hemolytic anemia while receiving cephalothin therapy .
An anti - cephalothin IgG antibody was detected in the patient 's serum and in the eluates from her erythrocytes .
In addition , nonimmunologic binding of normal and patient 's serum proteins to her own and cephalothin - coated normal red cells was demonstrated .
Skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation revealed that the patient was sensitized to cephalothin and also to ampicillin .
Careful investigation of drug - induced hemolytic anemias reveals the complexity of the immune mechanisms involved .
