Amiodarone - induced torsade de pointes during bladder irrigation : an unusual presentation - - a case report .
The authors present a case of early ( within 4 days ) development of torsade de pointes ( TdP ) associated with oral amiodarone therapy .
Consistent with other reports this case of TdP occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess .
Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of TdP .
It is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired TdP .
The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation , a vagal maneuver , in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone - induced proarrhythmia .
In the absence of amiodarone therapy , a second bladder irrigation did not induce TdP despite hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia .
