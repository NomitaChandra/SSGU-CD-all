Autoradiographic evidence of estrogen binding sites in nuclei of diethylstilbesterol induced hamster renal carcinomas .
Estrogen binding sites were demonstrated by autoradiography in one transplantable and five primary diethylstilbesterol induced renal carcinomas in three hamsters .
Radiolabelling , following the in vivo injection of 3H - 17 beta estradiol , was increased only over the nuclei of tumor cells ; stereologic analysis revealed a 4 . 5 - to 6 . 7 - times higher concentration of reduced silver grains over nuclei than cytoplasm of these cells .
Despite rapid tubular excretion of estradiol which peaked in less than 1 h , the normal cells did not appear to bind the ligand .
This is the first published report documenting the preferential in vivo binding of estrogen to nuclei of cells in estrogen induced hamster renal carcinomas .
