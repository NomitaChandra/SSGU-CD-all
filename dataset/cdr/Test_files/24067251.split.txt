An investigation of the pattern of kidney injury in HIV-positive persons exposed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: an examination of a large population database (MHRA database).
The potential for tenofovir to cause a range of kidney syndromes has been established from mechanistic and randomised clinical trials.
However, the exact pattern of kidney involvement is still uncertain.
We undertook a descriptive analysis of Yellow Card records of 407 HIV-positive persons taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as part of their antiretroviral therapy regimen and submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with suspected kidney adverse effects.
Reports that satisfy defined criteria were classified as acute kidney injury, kidney tubular dysfunction and Fanconi syndrome.
Of the 407 Yellow Card records analysed, 106 satisfied criteria for TDF-related kidney disease, of which 53 (50%) had features of kidney tubular dysfunction, 35 (33%) were found to have features of glomerular dysfunction and 18 (17%) had Fanconi syndrome.
The median TDF exposure was 316 days (interquartile range 120-740).
The incidence of hospitalisation for TDF kidney adverse effects was high, particularly amongst patients with features of Fanconi syndrome.
The pattern of kidney syndromes in this population series mirrors that reported in randomised clinical trials.
Cessation of TDF was associated with complete restoration of kidney function in up half of the patients in this report.
