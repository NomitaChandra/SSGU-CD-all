Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia : a practical review .
Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) remains under - recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes .
It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin - platelet factor 4 antibodies , which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles .
Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT , with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications .
The prevalence of HIT varies among several subgroups , with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations .
HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure .
Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment , as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes .
The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy , most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor .
Current " diagnostic " tests , which primarily include functional and antigenic assays , have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of HIT .
Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment .
Direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate , evidence - based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of HIT , who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention .
As heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for HIT with every heparin exposure , a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated .
