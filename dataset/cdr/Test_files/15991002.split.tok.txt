Nicotine antagonizes caffeine - but not pentylenetetrazole - induced anxiogenic effect in mice .
RATIONALE : Nicotine and caffeine are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide .
Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently .
Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them , no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses .
OBJECTIVES : The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug , pentylenetetrazole , in mice .
The elevated plus - maze ( EPM ) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety .
METHODS : Adult male Swiss Webster mice ( 25 - 32 g ) were given nicotine ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 25 mg / kg s . c . ) or saline 10 min before caffeine ( 70 mg / kg i . p . ) or pentylenetetrazole ( 15 and 30 mg / kg i . p . ) injections .
After 15 min , mice were evaluated for their open - and closed - arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10 - min session .
Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test .
RESULTS : Nicotine ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 25 mg / kg ) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test , whereas caffeine ( 70 mg / kg ) and pentylenetetrazole ( 30 mg / kg ) produced an anxiogenic effect , apparent with decreases in open - arm time and entry .
Nicotine ( 0 . 25 mg / kg ) pretreatment blocked the caffeine - but not pentylenetetrazole - induced anxiety .
Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity .
CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine - induced anxiety is specific to caffeine , instead of a non - specific anxiolytic effect .
Thus , it may extend the current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine .
