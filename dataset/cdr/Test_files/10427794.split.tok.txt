Meloxicam - induced liver toxicity .
We report the case of a female patient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed acute cytolytic hepatitis due to meloxicam .
Recently introduced in Belgium , meloxicam is the first nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug with selective action on the inducible form of cyclooxygenase 2 .
The acute cytolytic hepatitis occurred rapidly after meloxicam administration and was associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies suggesting a hypersensitivity mechanism .
This first case of meloxicam related liver toxicity demonstrates the potential of this drug to induce hepatic damage .
