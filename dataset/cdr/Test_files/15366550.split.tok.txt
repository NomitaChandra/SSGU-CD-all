Accurate patient history contributes to differentiating diabetes insipidus : a case study .
This case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history .
The case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus ( DI ) secondary to a traumatic brain injury .
The nursing staff , by reviewing the patient 's health history with his family , discovered a history of polydipsia and long - standing lithium use .
Lithium is implicated in drug - induced nephrogenic DI , and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital , his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic DI .
By combining information from the patient history , the physical examination , and radiologic and laboratory studies , the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self - treating his lithium - induced nephrogenic DI and developed neurogenic DI secondary to brain trauma .
Thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic DI be treated concomitantly .
