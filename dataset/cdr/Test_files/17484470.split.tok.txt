Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle : a pilot study .
BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY : Undersized mitral annuloplasty ( MAP ) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation ( MR ) since , as well as addressing the MR , the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular ( LV ) base .
However , the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood .
The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure .
METHODS : Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus , using four mattress sutures .
The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy .
Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function .
Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass ; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography .
MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets .
Data were acquired at baseline , after induction of acute heart failure , and after MAP .
RESULTS : MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure - commissure and septal - lateral directions .
Concomitantly , the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased ( i . e . , improved ) from 37 . 4 + / - 9 . 3 to 35 . 9 + / - 10 mm ( p = 0 . 063 ) , and from 67 . 9 + / - 18 . 6 % to 65 . 3 + / - 18 . 9 % ( p = 0 . 016 ) , respectively .
Decreases were evident in both LV end - diastolic pressure ( from 17 + / - 7 to 15 + / - 6 mmHg , p = 0 . 0480 and Tau ( from 48 + / - 8 to 45 + / - 8 ms , p < 0 . 01 ) , while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7 . 7 + / - 4 . 5 % to 9 . 4 + / - 4 . 5 % ( p = 0 . 045 ) .
After MAP , increases were identified in both cardiac output ( from 1 . 54 + / - 0 . 57 to 1 . 65 + / - 0 . 57 1 / min ) and Emax ( from 1 . 86 + / - 0 . 9 to 2 . 41 + / - 1 . 31 mmHg / ml ) .
CONCLUSION : The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension / function in acute heart failure , even in the absence of MR .
However , further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic heart failure .
