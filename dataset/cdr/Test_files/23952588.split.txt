Risk factors and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysians with Parkinson's disease.
Chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.
We studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months.
The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires.
The predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years.
The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years.
The median disease duration was 6 (7) years.
Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years.
There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays, and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups.
Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations.
Patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia.
The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%.
The most significant predictors were duration of levodopa therapy, total daily levodopa dose, and onset age.
