Deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with halothane , enflurane or isoflurane for middle - ear surgery .
The feasibility of using labetalol , an alpha - and beta - adrenergic blocking agent , as a hypotensive agent in combination with inhalation anaesthetics ( halothane , enflurane or isoflurane ) was studied in 23 adult patients undergoing middle - ear surgery .
The mean arterial pressure was decreased from 86 + / - 5 ( s . e .
mean ) mmHg to 52 + / - 1 mmHg ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 7 to 6 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 kPa ) for 98 + / - 10 min in the halothane ( H ) group , from 79 + / - 5 to 53 + / - 1 mmHg ( 10 . 5 + / - 0 . 7 to 7 . 1 + / - 0 . 1 kPa ) for 129 + / - 11 min in the enflurane ( E ) group , and from 80 + / - 4 to 49 + / - 1 mmHg ( 10 . 7 + / - 0 . 5 to 6 . 5 + / - 0 . 1 kPa ) for 135 + / - 15 min in the isoflurane ( I ) group .
The mean H concentration during hypotension in the inspiratory gas was 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 1 vol % , the mean E concentration 1 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 vol % , and the mean I concentration 1 . 0 + / - 0 . 1 vol % .
In addition , the patients received fentanyl and d - tubocurarine .
The initial dose of labetalol for lowering blood pressure was similar , 0 . 52 - 0 . 59 mg / kg , in all the groups .
During hypotension , the heart rate was stable without tachy - or bradycardia .
The operating conditions regarding bleeding were estimated in a double - blind manner , and did not differ significantly between the groups .
During hypotension , the serum creatinine concentration rose significantly in all groups from the values before hypotension and returned postoperatively to the initial level in the other groups , except the isoflurane group .
After hypotension there was no rebound phenomenon in either blood pressure or heart rate .
These results indicate that labetalol induces easily adjustable hypotension without compensatory tachycardia and rebound hypertension .
