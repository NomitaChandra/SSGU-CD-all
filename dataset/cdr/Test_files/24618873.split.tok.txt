Cerebellar and oculomotor dysfunction induced by rapid infusion of pethidine .
Pethidine is an opioid that gains its popularity for the effective pain control through acting on the opioid - receptors .
However , rapid pain relief sometimes brings about unfavourable side effects that largely limit its clinical utility .
Common side effects include nausea , vomiting and hypotension .
In patients with impaired renal and liver function , and those who need long - term pain control , pethidine may cause excitatory central nervous system ( CNS ) effects through its neurotoxic metabolite , norpethidine , resulting in irritability and seizure attack .
On the contrary , though not clinically apparent , pethidine potentially causes inhibitory impacts on the CNS and impairs normal cerebellar and oculomotor function in the short term .
In this case report , we highlight opioid 's inhibitory side effects on the cerebellar structure that causes dysmetria , dysarthria , reduced smooth pursuit gain and decreased saccadic velocity .
