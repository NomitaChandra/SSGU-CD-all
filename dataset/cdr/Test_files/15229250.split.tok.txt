Structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use methamphetamine .
We visualize , for the first time , the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine ( MA ) abuse .
Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities .
Using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and new computational brain - mapping techniques , we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment .
We used high - resolution MRI and surface - based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex , hippocampus , white matter , and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age - matched , healthy controls .
Cortical maps revealed severe gray - matter deficits in the cingulate , limbic , and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers ( averaging 11 . 3 % below control ; p < 0 . 05 ) .
On average , MA abusers had 7 . 8 % smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p < 0 . 01 ; left , p = 0 . 01 ; right , p < 0 . 05 ) and significant white - matter hypertrophy ( 7 . 0 % ; p < 0 . 01 ) .
Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word - recall test ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
MRI - based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance .
MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and , consistent with metabolic studies , the cingulate - limbic cortex , inducing neuroadaptation , neuropil reduction , or cell death .
Prominent white - matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes , including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage .
These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse , providing therapeutic targets for drug - induced brain injury .
