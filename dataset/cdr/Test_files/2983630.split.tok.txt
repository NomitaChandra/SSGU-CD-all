Increased anxiogenic effects of caffeine in panic disorders .
The effects of oral administration of caffeine ( 10 mg / kg ) on behavioral ratings , somatic symptoms , blood pressure and plasma levels of 3 - methoxy - 4 - hydroxyphenethyleneglycol ( MHPG ) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM - III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder .
Caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject - rated anxiety , nervousness , fear , nausea , palpitations , restlessness , and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects .
In the patients , but not the healthy subjects , these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels .
Seventy - one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks .
Caffeine did not alter plasma MHPG levels in either the healthy subjects or patients .
Caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups .
Because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist , these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine .
Patients with anxiety disorders may benefit by avoiding caffeine - containing foods and beverages .
