Early infections in kidney , heart , and liver transplant recipients on cyclosporine .
Eighty - one renal , seventeen heart , and twenty - four liver transplant patients were followed for infection .
Seventeen renal patients received azathioprine ( Aza ) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine - and - prednisone - treated renal transplant patients .
All others received cyclosporine and prednisone .
The randomized Aza patients had more overall infections ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and more nonviral infections ( P less than 0 . 02 ) than the randomized cyclosporine patients .
Heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the Aza renal patients .
There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or Aza , but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths .
Renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias .
Analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients , intrathoracic infections in heart patients , and urinary tract infections in renal patients .
Pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine - treated renal patients than in Aza - treated patients ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
Aza patients had significantly more staphylococcal infections than all other transplant groups ( P less than 0 . 005 ) , and systemic fungal infections occurred only in the liver transplant group .
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) shedding or serological rises in antibody titer , or both occurred in 78 % of cyclosporine patients and 76 % of Aza patients .
Of the cyclosporine patients , 15 % had symptoms related to CMV infection .
Serological evidence for Epstein Barr Virus infection was found in 20 % of 65 cyclosporine patients studied .
Three had associated symptoms , and one developed a lymphoma .
