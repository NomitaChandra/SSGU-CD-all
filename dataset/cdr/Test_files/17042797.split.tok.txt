Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the adult rat .
Following status epilepticus in the rat , dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly , and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically , in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation .
It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus .
However , the population has never been quantified , so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis .
To quantify this population , the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus .
The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox - 1 , a granule - cell - specific marker , was estimated using the optical fractionator method .
The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial , and stable over time .
Interestingly , the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures , because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures .
The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis , although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus .
The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
