Reversible valproic acid - induced dementia : a case report .
Reversible valproic acid - induced dementia was documented in a 21 - year - old man with epilepsy who had a 3 - year history of insidious progressive decline in global cognitive abilities documented by serial neuropsychological studies .
Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ , memory , naming , and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity .
Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include : a direct central nervous system ( CNS ) toxic effect of valproic acid ; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug ; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through valproic acid - induced hyperammonemia .
