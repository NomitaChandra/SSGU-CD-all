Famotidine - associated delirium .
A series of six cases .
Famotidine is a histamine H2 - receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost .
Although all of the currently available H2 - receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium , only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine .
The authors report on six cases of famotidine - associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine .
The pharmacokinetics of famotidine are reviewed , with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen .
The implications of using famotidine in elderly persons are discussed .
