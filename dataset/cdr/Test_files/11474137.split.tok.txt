Overexpression of copper / zinc - superoxide dismutase protects from kanamycin - induced hearing loss .
The participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside - induced ototoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside - iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ototoxicity in vivo .
We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Cu / Zn - superoxide dismutase ( h - SOD1 ) should protect transgenic mice from ototoxicity .
Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h - SOD1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic C57BL / 6 - TgN [ SOD1 ] 3Cje mice .
Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received kanamycin ( 400 mg / kg body weight / day ) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth .
Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth .
In nontransgenic animals , the threshold in the kanamycin - treated group was 45 - 50 dB higher than in saline - injected controls .
In the transgenic group , kanamycin increased the threshold by only 15 dB over the respective controls .
The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz .
The protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside - induced ototoxicity .
The results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention .
