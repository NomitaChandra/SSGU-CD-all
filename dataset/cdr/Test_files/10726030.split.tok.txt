Clinical aspects of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis and other side effects of heparin therapy .
Heparin , first used to prevent the clotting of blood in vitro , has been clinically used to treat thrombosis for more than 50 years .
Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development , heparin remains the anticoagulant of choice to treat acute thrombotic episodes .
The clinical effects of heparin are meritorious , but side effects do exist .
Bleeding is the primary untoward effect of heparin .
Major bleeding is of primary concern in patients receiving heparin therapy .
However , additional important untoward effects of heparin therapy include heparin - induced thrombocytopenia , heparin - associated osteoporosis , eosinophilia , skin reactions , allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia , alopecia , transaminasemia , hyperkalemia , hypoaldosteronism , and priapism .
These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual , but given the extremely widespread use of heparin , some are quite common , particularly HITT and osteoporosis .
Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be " softly " deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated heparin , at present the incidences of these side effects with newer low molecular weight heparins appear to be much less common .
However , only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations .
