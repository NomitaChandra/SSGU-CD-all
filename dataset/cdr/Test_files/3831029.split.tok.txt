Improvement by denopamine ( TA - 064 ) of pentobarbital - induced cardiac failure in the dog heart - lung preparation .
The efficacy of denopamine , an orally active beta 1 - adrenoceptor agonist , in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart - lung preparations .
Cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital ( 118 + / - 28 mg ; mean value + / - SD ) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure ( LV dP / dt max ) had been reduced by about 35 % and 26 % of the respective controls were improved by denopamine ( 10 - 300 micrograms ) in a dose - dependent manner .
With 100 micrograms denopamine , almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained , associated with a slight increase in heart rate .
No arrhythmias were induced by these doses of denopamine .
The results warrant clinical trials of denopamine in the treatment of cardiac failure .
