Hypercalcemia , arrhythmia , and mood stabilizers .
Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia .
A printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1 - year period was generated .
After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids , the authors identified 18 non - lithium - treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions ( group A ) and 12 patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia ( group B ) .
Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A , as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies .
Thus , two control groups were generated : group C1 , which included age - and sex - comparable lithium - treated bipolar normocalcemic patients , and group C2 , which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers .
The electrocardiographic ( ECG ) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2 .
It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities ; however , there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects .
Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium - associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects .
Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2 - year follow - up ( 28 % ) , in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups .
The clinical implications of these findings are discussed .
