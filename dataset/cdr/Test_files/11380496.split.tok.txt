Frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO - ANCA ) in Graves ' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil and the relationship between MPO - ANCA and clinical manifestations .
OBJECTIVE : Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO - ANCA ) - positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves ' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil ( PTU ) .
The appearance of MPO - ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO - ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped .
Nevertheless , there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO - ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy , or on the incidence of MPO - ANCA in untreated Graves ' disease patients .
Therefore , we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves ' disease .
PATIENTS : We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves ' disease for the presence of MPO - ANCA , and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy .
Twenty - nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months .
The remaining 73 patients ( 55 women and 18 men ) , all of whom were examined for more than 3 months , were adopted as the subjects of the investigation .
The median observation period was 23 . 6 months ( range : 3 - 37 months ) .
MEASUREMENTS : MPO - ANCA was measured at intervals of 2 - 6 months .
RESULTS : Before treatment , the MPO - ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves ' disease patients were within the reference range ( below 10 U / ml ) .
Three ( 4 . 1 % ) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO - ANCA at 13 , 16 and 17 months , respectively , after the start of PTU therapy .
In two of them , the MPO - ANCA titres transiently increased to 12 . 8 and 15 . 0 U / ml , respectively , despite continued PTU therapy , but no vasculitic disorders developed .
In the third patient , the MPO - ANCA titre increased to 204 U / ml and she developed a higher fever , oral ulcers and polyarthralgia , but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy , and the MPO - ANCA titre decreased to 20 . 7 U / ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU .
CONCLUSIONS : PTU therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO - ANCA , but MPO - ANCA does not appear to be closely related to vasculitis .
