Intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension associated with timolol and pilocarpine eye drops.
A 69-yr-old man, who was concurrently being treated with pilocarpine nitrate and timolol maleate eye drops, developed a bradycardia and became hypotensive during halothane anaesthesia.
Both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine.
Timolol (but not pilocarpine) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery; the plasma concentration of timolol (2.6 ng ml-1) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade.
It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during halothane anaesthesia with resultant bradycardia and hypotension.
Pilocarpine may have had a contributory effect.
