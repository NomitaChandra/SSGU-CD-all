Use of argatroban and catheter - directed thrombolysis with alteplase in an oncology patient with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis .
PURPOSE : The case of an oncology patient who developed heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis ( HITT ) and was treated with argatroban plus catheter - directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) with alteplase is presented .
SUMMARY : A 63 - year - old Caucasian man with renal amyloidosis undergoing peripheral blood stem cell collection for an autologous stem cell transplant developed extensive bilateral upper - extremity deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism secondary to heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
A continuous i . v .
infusion of argatroban was initiated , and the patient was managed on the general medical floor .
After one week of therapy , he was transferred to the intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary compromise related to superior vena cava ( SVC ) syndrome .
A percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and CDT with alteplase were attempted , but the procedure was aborted due to epistaxis .
The epistaxis resolved the next day , and the patient was restarted on argatroban .
A second percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed six days later and resulted in partial revascularization of the SVC and central veins .
Postthrombectomy continuous CDT with alteplase was commenced while argatroban was withheld , and complete patency of the SVC and central veins was achieved after three days of therapy .
Alteplase was discontinued , and the patient was reinitiated on argatroban ; ultimately , he was transitioned to warfarin for long - term anticoagulation .
Although the patient recovered , he experienced permanent vision and hearing loss , as well as end - stage renal disease .
CONCLUSION : A 63 - year - old man with renal amyloidosis and SVC syndrome secondary to HITT was successfully treated with argatroban and CDT with alteplase .
