Efficacy and safety of granisetron , a selective 5 - hydroxytryptamine - 3 receptor antagonist , in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high - dose cisplatin .
PURPOSE : To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron ( Kytril ; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals , Philadelphia , PA ) when administered as a single intravenous ( IV ) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin - induced nausea and vomiting .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : One hundred eighty - four chemotherapy - naive patients receiving high - dose cisplatin ( 81 to 120 mg / m2 ) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses ( 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 micrograms / kg ) administered before chemotherapy .
Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours , and vital signs , nausea , vomiting , retching , and appetite were assessed .
Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes .
RESULTS : After granisetron doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 micrograms / kg , a major response ( < or = two vomiting or retching episodes , and no antiemetic rescue ) was recorded in 23 % , 57 % , 58 % , and 60 % of patients , respectively , and a complete response ( no vomiting or retching , and no antiemetic rescue ) in 18 % , 41 % , 40 % , and 47 % of patients , respectively .
There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea ( P = . 0015 ) and vomiting ( P = . 0001 ) , and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10 - micrograms / kg dosing groups than in the 5 - micrograms / kg dosing group .
As granisetron dose increased , appetite return increased ( P = . 040 ) .
Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event ( 20 % ) .
CONCLUSION : A single 10 - , 20 - , or 40 - micrograms / kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57 % to 60 % of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg / m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40 % to 47 % of patients .
There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10 - micrograms / kg dose and the 20 - and 40 - micrograms / kg doses .
Granisetron was well tolerated at all doses .
