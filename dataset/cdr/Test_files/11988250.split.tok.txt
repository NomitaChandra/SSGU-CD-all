Pulmonary hypertension after ibuprofen prophylaxis in very preterm infants .
We report three cases of severe hypoxaemia after ibuprofen administration during a randomised controlled trial of prophylactic treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with ibuprofen in premature infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation .
Echocardiography showed severely decreased pulmonary blood flow .
Hypoxaemia resolved quickly on inhaled nitric oxide therapy .
We suggest that investigators involved in similar trials pay close attention to pulmonary pressure if hypoxaemia occurs after prophylactic administration of ibuprofen .
