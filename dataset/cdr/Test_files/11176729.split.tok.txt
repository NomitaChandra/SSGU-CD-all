Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .
The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .
BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .
The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .
METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .
Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .
We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .
RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .
Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .
Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .
Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .
CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .
