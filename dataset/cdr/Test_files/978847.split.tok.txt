Centrally mediated cardiovascular effects of intracisternal application of carbachol in anesthetized rats .
The pressor response to the intracisternal ( i . c . ) injection of carbachol ( 1 mug ) in anesthetized rats was analyzed .
This response was significantly reduced by the intravenous ( i . v . ) injection of guanethidine ( 5 mg ) , hexamethonium ( 10 mg ) or phentolamine ( 5 mg ) , and conversely , potentiated by i . v .
desmethylimipramine ( 0 . 3 mg ) , while propranolol ( 0 . 5 mg ) i . v .
selectively inhibited the enlargement of pulse pressure and the tachycardia following i . c .
carbachol ( 1 mug ) .
On the other hand , the pressor response to i . c .
carbachol ( 1 mug ) was almost completely blocked by i . c .
atropine ( 3 mug ) or hexamethonium ( 500 mug ) , and significantly reduced by i . c .
chlorpromazine ( 50 mug ) but significantly potentiated by i . c .
desmethylimipramine ( 30 mug ) .
The pressor response to i . c .
carbachol ( 1 mug ) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord ( C7 - C8 ) .
From the above result it is suggested that the pressor response to i . c .
carbachol ortral and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms , and that the sympathetic trunk is the main pathway .
