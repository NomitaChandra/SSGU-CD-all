Rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine - untreated Iranian patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection .
BACKGROUND : Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients .
Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants ( resistant hepatitis B virus ) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine - untreated chronic hepatitis B patients .
In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine - untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study .
Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR - RFLP ) for detection of YMDD motif mutants .
All patients were also tested for liver enzymes , anti - HCV , HBeAg , and anti - HBe .
RESULTS : Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study , 73 % were male and 27 % were female .
Mean ALT and AST levels were 124 . 4 + / - 73 . 4 and 103 . 1 + / - 81 IU / l , respectively .
HBeAg was positive in 40 % and anti - HBe in 60 % of the patients .
Anti - HCV was negative in all of them .
YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti - HBe .
CONCLUSION : Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine - untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B has been reported , these mutants were not detected in Iranian lamivudine - untreated chronic hepatitis B patients .
