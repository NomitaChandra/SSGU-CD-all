Tacrolimus - related seizure after pediatric liver transplantation - - a single - center experience .
To identify the risk factors for new - onset seizures after pediatric LT and to assess their clinical implications and long - term prognosis .
The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively .
Patients were divided into seizures group and a non - seizures group .
Pre - operative , intra - operative , and post - operative data were collected .
Seizures occurred in four children , an incidence of 14 . 8 % .
All exhibited generalized tonic - clonic seizures within the first two wk after LT .
Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with seizures after pediatric LT included gender , pediatric end - stage liver disease score before surgery , Child - Pugh score before surgery , serum total bilirubin after surgery , and trough TAC level .
Multivariate analysis showed that trough TAC level was the only independent risk factor associated with the seizures .
All children who experienced seizures survived with good graft function and remained seizure - free without anti - epileptic drugs over a mean follow - up period of 33 . 7 + 14 . 6 months .
High trough TAC level was the predominant factor that contributed to seizures in the early post - operative period after pediatric LT .
High PELD and Child - Pugh scores before LT and high post - operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for TAC - related seizures .
