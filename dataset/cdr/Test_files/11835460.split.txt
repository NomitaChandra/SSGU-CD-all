Levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.
Levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias are very uncommon.
Usually they occur simultaneously with limb peak-dose choreatic dyskinesias.
We report on a patient with leftward and upward deviations of gaze during the peak effect of levodopa, and hypothesize that a severe dopaminergic denervation in the caudate nucleus is needed for the appearance of these levodopa-induce ocular dyskinesias.
