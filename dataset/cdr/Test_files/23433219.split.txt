The risk and associated factors of methamphetamine psychosis in methamphetamine-dependent patients in Malaysia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine-induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence.
The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and methamphetamine-induced psychosis was also studied.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia.
Patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for methamphetamine-induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders.
The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records.
RESULTS: Of 292 subjects, 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms.
Co-morbid major depressive disorder (OR=7.18, 95 CI=2.612-19.708), bipolar disorder (OR=13.807, 95 CI=5.194-36.706), antisocial personality disorder (OR=12.619, 95 CI=6.702-23.759) and heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine-induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors.
Major depressive disorder (OR=2.870, CI=1.154-7.142) and antisocial personality disorder (OR=3.299, 95 CI=1.375-7.914) were the only factors associated with current psychosis.
CONCLUSION: There was a high risk of psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence.
It was associated with co-morbid affective disorder, antisocial personality, and heavy methamphetamine use.
It is recommended that all cases of methamphetamine dependence should be screened for psychotic symptoms.
