Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson 's disease .
High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Parkinson 's disease .
AIM : We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients .
METHOD : Twenty - three patients suffering from severe Parkinson 's disease ( Stages III - V on Hoehn and Yahr scale ) and , particularly bradykinesia , rigidity , and levodopa - induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN .
Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months follow - up , in " on " and " off " drug conditions , was carried out using Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale , Hoehn and Yahr staging , England activities of daily living score and video recordings .
RESULTS : After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN , the patients ' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores ( Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III ) off medication improved by 62 % and 61 % respectively ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
The subscores for the akinesia , rigidity , tremor and gait also improved .
( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg .
The cognitive functions remained unchanged .
Two patients developed device - related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain .
CONCLUSION : Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson 's disease .
It reduces the severity of " off " phase symptoms , improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements .
The reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug - induced dyskinesias .
