Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d , l - sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias .
This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy , the incidence of torsades de pointes , and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d , l - sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias .
Eighty - one consecutive patients ( 54 with coronary artery disease , and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy ) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d , l - sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia .
During oral loading with d , l - sotalol , continuous electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring was performed .
Those patients in whom d , l - sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 + / - 18 months .
Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d , l - sotalol in 35 ( 43 % ) patients ; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 ( 49 % ) patients ; and two ( 2 . 5 % ) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d , l - sotalol once daily .
Four ( 5 % ) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d , l - sotalol .
Neither ECG [ sinus - cycle length ( SCL ) , QT or QTc interval , or U wave ] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes .
However , the oral dose of d , l - sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes ( 200 + / - 46 vs . 328 + / - 53 mg / day ; p = 0 . 0017 ) .
Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave ( p = 0 . 049 ) , female gender ( p = 0 . 015 ) , and significant dose - corrected changes of SCL , QT interval , and QTc interval ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
During follow - up , seven ( 20 % ) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence , and two ( 6 % ) patients died suddenly .
One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d , l - sotalol .
Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d , l - sotalol .
Pronounced changes in the surface ECG ( cycle length , QT , and QTc ) in relation to the dose of oral d , l - sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes .
Other ECG parameters before the application of d , l - sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes .
Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation .
Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d , l - sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value .
