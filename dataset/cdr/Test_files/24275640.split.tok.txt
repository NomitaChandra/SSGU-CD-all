Oxidative stress on cardiotoxicity after treatment with single and multiple doses of doxorubicin .
The mechanism of doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial .
Wistar rats ( n = 66 ) received DOX injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols : ( 1 ) rats were killed before ( - 24 h , n = 8 ) and 24 h after ( + 24 h , n = 8 ) a single dose of DOX ( 4 mg / kg body weight ) to determine the DOX acute effect and ( 2 ) rats ( n = 58 ) received 4 injections of DOX ( 4 mg / kg body weight / week ) and were killed before the first injection ( M0 ) and 1 week after each injection ( M1 , M2 , M3 , and M4 ) to determine the chronological effects .
Animals used at M0 ( n = 8 ) were also used at moment - 24 h of acute study .
Cardiac total antioxidant performance ( TAP ) , DNA damage , and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point .
Single dose of DOX was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement , necrosis , and DNA damage ( strand breaks ( SBs ) and oxidized pyrimidines ) and decreased TAP .
The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight ( R = - 0 . 99 , p = 0 . 011 ) , necrosis ( R = 1 . 00 , p = 0 . 004 ) , TAP ( R = 0 . 95 , p = 0 . 049 ) , and DNA SBs ( R = - 0 . 95 , p = 0 . 049 ) .
DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP ( R = - 0 . 98 , p = 0 . 018 ) , and necrosis ( R = - 0 . 97 , p = 0 . 027 ) .
Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of DOX only .
Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of DOX .
Thus , different mechanisms may be involved in acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity .
