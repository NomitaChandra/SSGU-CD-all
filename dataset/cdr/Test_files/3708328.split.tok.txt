Susceptibility to seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats after microinjection of isoniazid or gamma - vinyl - GABA into the substantia nigra .
Pilocarpine , given intraperitoneally to rats , reproduces the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buildup of convulsive activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of seizures within the forebrain .
In the present study , the effects of manipulating the activity of the gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) - mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats , were investigated .
In animals pretreated with microinjections of isoniazid , 150 micrograms , an inhibitor of activity of the GABA - synthesizing enzyme , L - glutamic acid decarboxylase , into the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNR ) , bilaterally , non - convulsant doses of pilocarpine , 100 and 200 mg / kg , resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus .
Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine - induced convulsions .
Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure - related damage to the hippocampal formation , thalamus , amygdala , olfactory cortex , substantia nigra and neocortex , which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg / kg .
Bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine , 200 mg / kg .
Application of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase , gamma - vinyl - GABA ( D , L - 4 - amino - hex - 5 - enoic acid ) , 5 micrograms , into the SNR , bilaterally , suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / kg .
This treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain damage .
Microinjections of gamma - vinyl - GABA , 5 micrograms , into the dorsal striatum , bilaterally , failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / kg .
The results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine - induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the GABA - mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra .
