A prospective, open-label trial of galantamine in autistic disorder.
OBJECTIVE: Post-mortem studies have reported abnormalities of the cholinergic system in autism.
The purpose of this study was to assess the use of galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic receptor modulator, in the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with autism.
METHODS: Thirteen medication-free children with autism (mean age, 8.8 +/- 3.5 years) participated in a 12-week, open-label trial of galantamine.
Patients were rated monthly by parents on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, and by a physician using the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale.
RESULTS: Patients showed a significant reduction in parent-rated irritability and social withdrawal on the ABC as well as significant improvements in emotional lability and inattention on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale--Revised.
Similarly, clinician ratings showed reductions in the anger subscale of the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale.
Eight of 13 participants were rated as responders on the basis of their improvement scores on the Clinical Global Impressions scale.
Overall, galantamine was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects apart from headaches in one patient.
CONCLUSION: In this open trial, galantamine was well-tolerated and appeared to be beneficial for the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with autism, particularly aggression, behavioral dyscontrol, and inattention.
Further controlled trials are warranted.
