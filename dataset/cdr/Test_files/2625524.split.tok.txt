The effect of haloperidol in cocaine and amphetamine intoxication .
The effectiveness of haloperidol pretreatment in preventing the toxic effects of high doses of amphetamine and cocaine was studied in rats .
In this model , toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection of amphetamine 75 mg / kg ( 100 % death rate ) or cocaine 70 mg / kg ( 82 % death rate ) .
Haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine - induced seizures , but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested .
Haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine - induced seizures at the two highest doses , but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose .
These data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high - dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seizures .
In contrast , haloperidol demonstrated an ability to reduce cocaine - induced seizures without significantly reducing mortality .
