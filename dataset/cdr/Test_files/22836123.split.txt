Late-onset scleroderma renal crisis induced by tacrolimus and prednisolone: a case report.
Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) but can be severe enough to require temporary or permanent renal replacement therapy.
Moderate to high dose corticosteroid use is recognized as a major risk factor for SRC.
Furthermore, there have been reports of thrombotic microangiopathy precipitated by cyclosporine in patients with SSc.
In this article, we report a patient with SRC induced by tacrolimus and corticosteroids.
The aim of this work is to call attention to the risk of tacrolimus use in patients with SSc.
