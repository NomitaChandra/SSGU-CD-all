Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events : an update of the evidence for the U . S .
Preventive Services Task Force .
BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States .
In 2002 , the U . S .
Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease .
PURPOSE : To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions , strokes , and death .
DATA SOURCES : MEDLINE and Cochrane Library ( search dates , 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008 ) , recent systematic reviews , reference lists of retrieved articles , and suggestions from experts .
STUDY SELECTION : English - language randomized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) ; case - control studies ; meta - analyses ; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) were selected to answer the following questions : Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events , strokes , death from coronary heart events or stroke , or all - cause mortality in adults without known CVD ? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes ? DATA EXTRACTION : All studies were reviewed , abstracted , and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria .
DATA SYNTHESIS : New evidence from 1 good - quality RCT , 1 good - quality meta - analysis , and 2 fair - quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD .
Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes .
Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all - cause mortality in either men or women .
The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events , primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events , in both men and women .
Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use .
A new RCT and meta - analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased .
LIMITATIONS : New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited .
The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied , which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention .
Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals , which potentially limits generalizability .
CONCLUSION : Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women .
Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events .
