Factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .
BACKGROUND AND AIM : Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia .
This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .
METHODS : Eighty - eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon - alpha - 2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study .
A hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g / dL was defined as ribavirin - induced anemia .
RESULTS : Ribavirin - induced anemia occurred in 18 ( 20 . 5 % ) patients during treatment .
A 2 g / dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment .
The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or = 2 g / dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with < 2 g / dL decrease ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
Such factors as sex ( female ) , age ( > or = 60 years old ) , and the ribavirin dose by body weight ( 12 mg / kg or more ) were significant by univariate analysis .
CONCLUSIONS : Careful administration is necessary in patients > or = 60 years old , in female patients , and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg / kg or more .
Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g / dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care .
