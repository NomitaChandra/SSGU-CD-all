Clinical evaluation of adverse effects during bepridil administration for atrial fibrillation and flutter .
BACKGROUND : Bepridil hydrochloride ( Bpd ) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and atrial flutter ( AFL ) .
However , serious adverse effects , including torsade de pointes ( Tdp ) , have been reported .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated .
Bpd was administered to 459 patients ( 361 males , 63 + / - 12 years old ) comprising 378 AF and 81 AFL cases .
Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension ( LAD ) were 66 + / - 11 % and 40 + / - 6 mm , respectively .
Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients ( 4 % ) during an average follow - up of 20 months .
There was marked QT prolongation greater than 0 . 55 s in 13 patients , bradycardia less than 40 beats / min in 6 patients , dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each .
In 4 of 13 patients with QT prolongation , Tdp occurred .
The major triggering factors of Tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate .
There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without Tdp other than LAD and age , which were larger and older in the patients with Tdp .
CONCLUSION : Careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ECG should always be done during Bpd administration , particularly in elderly patients .
