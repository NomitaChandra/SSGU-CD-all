Curcumin prevents maleate - induced nephrotoxicity : relation to hemodynamic alterations , oxidative stress , mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I .
The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin ( 120 mg / Kg / day for 6 days ) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated .
Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate ( 400 mg / kg ) in rats .
Maleate - induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein , glucose , sodium , neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) and N - acetyl b - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , upregulation of kidney injury molecule ( KIM ) - 1 , decrease in renal blood flow and claudin - 2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h .
Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels .
Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC - PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups .
Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in LLC - PK1 cells in culture .
In addition , maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP - stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate / glutamate as substrate .
The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished .
All the above - described alterations were prevented by curcumin .
It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate - induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage .
The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I , and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production .
