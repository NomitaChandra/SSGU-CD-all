Characterization of a novel BCHE " silent " allele : point mutation ( p . Val204Asp ) causes loss of activity and prolonged apnea with suxamethonium .
Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants ( suxamethonium or mivacurium ) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene .
Here , we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant ( c . 695T > A , p . Val204Asp ) .
Inhibition studies , kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a " silent " phenotype .
Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine ( BTC ) and benzoylcholine , and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype .
Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast - moving BChE components : monomer , dimer , and monomer - albumin conjugate are missing .
Kinetic analysis showed that the p . Val204Asp / p . Asp70Gly - p . Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate .
Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for BTC , two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme , and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium .
Molecular dynamic ( MD ) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p . Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441 , leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate .
MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased , suggesting a pre - denaturation state .
This fits with the reduced concentration of p . Ala204Asp / p . Asp70Gly - p . Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme in the plasma and non - detectable fast moving - bands on electrophoresis gels .
