Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion associated with desvenlafaxine .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of syndrome of inappropriate anti - diuretic hormone ( SIADH ) secretion associated with desvenlafaxine .
CASE SUMMARY : A 57 - year old female with hyponatraemia .
Her medications included desvenlafaxine , and symptoms included nausea , anxiety and confusion .
The serum sodium at this time was 120 mmol / L , serum osmolality was 263 mosmol / kg , urine osmolality 410 mosmol / kg and urine sodium 63 mmol / L , consistent with a diagnosis of SIADH .
Desvenlafaxine was ceased and fluid restriction implemented .
After 4 days the sodium increased to 128 mmol / L and fluid restriction was relaxed .
During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission the serum sodium ranged from 134 to 137 mmol / L during treatment with mirtazapine .
DISCUSSION : SIADH has been widely reported with a range of antidepressants .
This case report suggests that desvenlafaxine might cause clinically significant hyponatremia .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware of the potential for antidepressants to cause hyponatremia , and take appropriate corrective action where necessary .
