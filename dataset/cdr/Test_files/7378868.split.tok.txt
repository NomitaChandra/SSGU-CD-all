Suxamethonium - induced jaw stiffness and myalgia associated with atypical cholinesterase : case report .
An 11 - year - old boy was given halothane , nitrous oxide and oxygen , pancuronium 0 . 4 mg and suxamethonium 100 mg for induction of anaesthesia .
In response to this a marked jaw stiffness occurred which lasted for two minutes and the anaesthesia were terminated .
Four hours of apnoea ensued and he suffered generalized severe myalgia lasting for one week .
He was found to have atypical plasma cholinesterase with a dibucaine number of 12 , indicating homozygocity .
This was verified by study of the family .
The case shows that prolonged jaw rigidity and myalgia may occur after suxamethonium in patients with atypical cholinesterase despite pretreatment with pancuronium .
