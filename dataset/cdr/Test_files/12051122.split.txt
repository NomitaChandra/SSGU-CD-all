Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone reported with the use of Vincristine: an over-representation of Asians?
PURPOSE: This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) among vincristine-treated patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups.
METHOD: We searched the Eli Lilly and Company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine.
RESULTS: A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified.
The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients.
The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males.
Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma.
Among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 Black, 3 Caucasian, and 35 Asian.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use.
Although the overall reported rate of SIADH associated with vincristine is very low, physicians caring for Asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event.
