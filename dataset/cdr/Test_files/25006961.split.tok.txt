Absence of PKC - alpha attenuates lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .
Lithium , an effective antipsychotic , induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) in 40 % of patients .
The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter ( UT - A1 ) and water channel ( AQP2 ) expression in the inner medulla .
Targeting an alternative signaling pathway , such as PKC - mediated signaling , may be an effective method of treating lithium - induced polyuria .
PKC - alpha null mice ( PKCa KO ) and strain - matched wild type ( WT ) controls were treated with lithium for 0 , 3 or 5 days .
WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration .
Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice ; however , AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO .
Similar results were observed with UT - A1 expression .
Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks .
Lithium - treated WT mice had 19 - fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4 - fold increase in output .
AQP2 and UT - A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium - treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice , AQP2 was only reduced by 2 - fold and UT - A1 expression was unaffected .
Urinary sodium , potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium - fed WT but not in lithium - fed PKCa KO mice .
Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT - A1 protein expression and localization in lithium - induced NDI , and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy .
