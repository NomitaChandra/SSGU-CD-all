Recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with aminocaproic acid therapy and acute renal artery thrombosis .
Case report .
Epsilon aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) has been used to prevent rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) .
Although this agent does decrease the frequency of rebleeding , several reports have described thrombotic complications of EACA therapy .
These complications have included clinical deterioration and intracranial vascular thrombosis in patients with SAH , arteriolar and capillary fibrin thrombi in patients with fibrinolytic syndromes treated with EACA , or other thromboembolic phenomena .
Since intravascular fibrin thrombi are often observed in patients with fibrinolytic disorders , EACA should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or other " consumption coagulopathies . " This report describes subtotal infarction of the kidney due to thrombosis of a normal renal artery .
This occlusion occurred after EACA therapy in a patient with SAH and histopathological documentation of recurrent SAH .
The corresponding clinical event was characterized by marked hypertension and abrupt neurological deterioration .
