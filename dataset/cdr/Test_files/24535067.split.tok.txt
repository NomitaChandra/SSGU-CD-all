Prevention of etomidate - induced myoclonus : which is superior : Fentanyl , midazolam , or a combination ? A Retrospective comparative study .
BACKGROUND : In this retrospective comparative study , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl , midazolam , and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate - induced myoclonus .
MATERIAL AND METHODS : This study was performed based on anesthesia records .
Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate , the patients were separated into 4 groups : no pretreatment ( Group NP ) , fentanyl 1 ug . kg - 1 ( Group F ) , midazolam 0 . 03 mg . kg - 1 ( Group M ) , and midazolam 0 . 015 mg . kg - 1 + fentanyl 0 . 5 ug . kg - 1 ( Group FM ) .
Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected : 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs , anesthesia is induced with 0 . 3 mg . kg - 1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20 - 30 seconds .
Myoclonic movements are evaluated , which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection .
The severity of pain due to etomidate injection , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and adverse effects were also evaluated .
RESULTS : Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 25 % in Group NP , Group F , Group M , and Group FM , respectively , and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM .
CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate - induced myoclonus .
