Phenytoin encephalopathy as probable idiosyncratic reaction : case report .
A case of phenytoin ( DPH ) encephalopathy with increasing seizures and EEG and mental changes is described .
Despite adequate oral dosage of DPH ( 5 mg / kg / daily ) the plasma level was very low ( 2 . 8 microgramg / ml ) .
The encephalopathy was probably an idiosyncratic and not toxic or allergic reaction .
In fact the concentration of free DPH was normal , the patient presented a retarded morbilliform rash during DPH treatment , the protidogram was normal , and an intradermic DPH injection had no local effect .
The authors conclude that in a patient starting DPH treatment an unexpected increase in seizures , with EEG and mental changes occurring simultaneously , should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating DPH from the therapeutic regimen , even if plasma concentrations are low .
