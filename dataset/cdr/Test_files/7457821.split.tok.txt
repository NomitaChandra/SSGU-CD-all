Etomidate : a foreshortened clinical trial .
A clinical evaluation of etomidate for outpatient cystoscopy was embarked upon .
Unpremedicated patients were given fentanyl 1 microgram / kg followed by etomidate 0 . 3 mg / kg .
Anaesthesia was maintained with intermittent etomidate in 2 - 4 mg doses .
Patients were interviewed personally later the same day , and by questionnaire three to four weeks later .
The trial was discontinued after 20 cases because of an unacceptable incidence of side effects .
Venous pain occurred in 68 % of patients and 50 % had redness , pain or swelling related to the injection site , in some cases lasting up to three weeks after anaesthesia .
Skeletal movements occurred in 50 % of patients ; 30 % experienced respiratory upset , one sufficiently severe to necessitate abandoning the technique .
Nausea and vomiting occurred in 40 % and 25 % had disturbing emergence psychoses .
