Randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first - episode schizophrenia : 4 - month outcomes .
OBJECTIVE : The authors compared 4 - month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first - episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders .
METHOD : One hundred twelve subjects ( 70 % male ; mean age = 23 . 3 years [ SD = 5 . 1 ] ) with first - episode schizophrenia ( 75 % ) , schizophreniform disorder ( 17 % ) , or schizoaffective disorder ( 8 % ) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine ( 2 . 5 - 20 mg / day ) or risperidone ( 1 - 6 mg / day ) .
RESULTS : Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine ( 43 . 7 % , 95 % CI = 28 . 8 % - 58 . 6 % ) and risperidone ( 54 . 3 % , 95 % CI = 39 . 9 % - 68 . 7 % ) .
Among those responding to treatment , more subjects in the olanzapine group ( 40 . 9 % , 95 % CI = 16 . 8 % - 65 . 0 % ) than in the risperidone group ( 18 . 9 % , 95 % CI = 0 % - 39 . 2 % ) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria .
Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications .
Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1 . 4 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 2 - 1 . 6 ) with risperidone and 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 0 - 1 . 4 ) with olanzapine .
Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone : the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17 . 3 % ( 95 % CI = 14 . 2 % - 20 . 5 % ) with olanzapine and 11 . 3 % ( 95 % CI = 8 . 4 % - 14 . 3 % ) with risperidone .
Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24 . 3 ( 95 % CI = 22 . 8 - 25 . 7 ) versus 28 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 26 . 7 - 29 . 7 ) with olanzapine and 23 . 9 ( 95 % CI = 22 . 5 - 25 . 3 ) versus 26 . 7 ( 95 % CI = 25 . 2 - 28 . 2 ) with risperidone .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine , and response may be more stable .
Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects .
Both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain , but weight gain was greater with olanzapine .
