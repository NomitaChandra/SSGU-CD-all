Association of common genetic variants of HOMER1 gene with levodopa adverse effects in Parkinson 's disease patients .
Levodopa is the most effective symptomatic therapy for Parkinson 's disease , but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes , such as motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and visual hallucinations .
HOMER1 is a protein with pivotal function in glutamate transmission , which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications .
This study investigates whether polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of levodopa therapy .
A total of 205 patients with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease were investigated .
Patients were genotyped for rs4704559 , rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with Taqman assays .
The rs4704559 G allele was associated with a lower prevalence of dyskinesia ( prevalence ratio ( PR ) = 0 . 615 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0 . 426 - 0 . 887 , P = 0 . 009 ) and visual hallucinations ( PR = 0 . 515 , 95 % CI 0 . 295 - 0 . 899 , P = 0 . 020 ) .
Our data suggest that HOMER1 rs4704559 G allele has a protective role for the development of levodopa adverse effects .
