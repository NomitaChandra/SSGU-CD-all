Long-term lithium therapy leading to hyperparathyroidism: a case report.
PURPOSE: This paper reviews the effect of chronic lithium therapy on serum calcium level and parathyroid glands, its pathogenesis, and treatment options.
We examined the case of a lithium-treated patient who had recurrent hypercalcemia to better understand the disease process.
CONCLUSION: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of long-term lithium therapy.
Careful patient selection and long-term follow-up can reduce morbidity.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: As much as 15% of lithium-treated patients become hypercalcemic.
By routinely monitoring serum calcium levels, healthcare providers can improve the quality of life of this patient group.
