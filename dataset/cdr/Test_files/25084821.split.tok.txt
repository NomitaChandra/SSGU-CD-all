Quetiapine - induced neutropenia in a bipolar patient with hepatocellular carcinoma .
OBJECTIVE : Quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine derivative , similar to clozapine , which has the highest risk of causing blood dyscrasias , especially neutropenia .
There are some case reports about this side effect of quetiapine , but possible risk factors are seldom discussed and identified .
A case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma that developed neutropenia after treatment with quetiapine is described here .
CASE REPORT : A 62 - year - old Taiwanese widow with bipolar disorder was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma at age 60 .
She developed leucopenia after being treated with quetiapine .
After quetiapine was discontinued , her white blood cell count returned to normal .
CONCLUSIONS : Although neutropenia is not a common side effect of quetiapine , physicians should be cautious about its presentation and associated risk factors .
Hepatic dysfunction may be one of the possible risk factors , and concomitant fever may be a diagnostic marker for adverse reaction to quetiapine .
