Effect of doxorubicin on [ omega - I - 131 ] heptadecanoic acid myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography in dogs .
The effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with [ omega - I - 131 ] heptadecanoic acid ( I - 131 HA ) , and on global left - ventricular function determined echocardiographically , were studied in a group of nine mongrel dogs .
Total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and doxorubicin - treated dogs .
A significant and then progressive fall in global LV function was observed at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 4 mg / kg .
A significant increase in the myocardial t1 / 2 of the I - 131 HA was observed only at a higher cumulative dose , 10 mg / kg .
No significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with doxorubicin .
Our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with I - 131 HA are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity .
