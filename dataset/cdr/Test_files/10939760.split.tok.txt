Patterns of sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity .
Sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity is reviving specially because of its use in toxoplasmosis in HIV - positive patients .
We report 4 cases , one of them in a previously healthy person .
Under treatment with sulfadiazine they developed oliguria , abdominal pain , renal failure and showed multiple radiolucent renal calculi in echography .
All patients recovered their previous normal renal function after adequate hydration and alcalinization .
A nephrostomy tube had to be placed in one of the patients for ureteral lithiasis in a single functional kidney .
None of them needed dialysis or a renal biopsy because of a typical benign course .
Treatment with sulfadiazine requires exquisite control of renal function , an increase in water ingestion and possibly the alcalinization of the urine .
We communicate a case in a previously healthy person , a fact not found in the recent literature .
Probably many more cases are not detected .
We think that a prospective study would be useful .
