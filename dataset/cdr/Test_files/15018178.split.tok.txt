MRI findings of hypoxic cortical laminar necrosis in a child with hemolytic anemia crisis .
We present magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 5 - year - old girl who had a rapidly installing hemolytic anemia crisis induced by trimethoprim - sulfomethoxazole , resulting in cerebral anoxia leading to permanent damage .
Magnetic Resonance imaging revealed cortical laminar necrosis in arterial border zones in both cerebral hemispheres , ischemic changes in subcortical white matter of left cerebral hemisphere , and in the left putamen .
Although cortical laminar necrosis is a classic entity in adulthood related to conditions of energy depletions , there are few reports available in children .
A wide review of the literature is also presented .
