Pre - treatment of bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular depression using different lipid formulations of propofol .
BACKGROUND : Pre - treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of bupivacaine , and the lipid content of propofol may alleviate bupivacaine - induced cardiotoxicity .
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of propofol in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on bupivacaine - induced cardiotoxicity .
METHODS : Rats were anaesthetised with ketamine and were given 0 . 5 mg / kg / min propofol in intralipid ( Group P ) , propofol in medialipid ( Group L ) , or saline ( Group C ) over 20 min .
Thereafter , 2 mg / kg / min bupivacaine 0 . 5 % was infused .
We recorded time to first dysrhythmia occurrence , respective times to 25 % and 50 % reduction of the heart rate ( HR ) and mean arterial pressure , and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption .
Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole .
RESULTS : The time to first dysrhythmia occurrence , time to 25 % and 50 % reductions in HR , and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups .
The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P . Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C .
Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C .
CONCLUSION : We conclude that pre - treatment with propofol in intralipid , compared with propofol in medialipid or saline , delayed the onset of bupivacaine - induced cardiotoxic effects as well as reduced plasma bupivacaine levels .
Further studies are needed to explore tissue bupivacaine levels of propofol in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice .
