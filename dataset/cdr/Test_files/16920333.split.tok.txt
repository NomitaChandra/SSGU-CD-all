Anticonvulsant effect of eslicarbazepine acetate ( BIA 2 - 093 ) on seizures induced by microperfusion of picrotoxin in the hippocampus of freely moving rats .
Eslicarbazepine acetate ( BIA 2 - 093 , S - ( - ) - 10 - acetoxy - 10 , 11 - dihydro - 5H - dibenzo / b , f / azepine - 5 - carboxamide ) is a novel antiepileptic drug , now in Phase III clinical trials , designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine ( CBZ ) and oxcarbazepine ( OXC ) .
We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole - animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns .
In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin , the average number of seizures was 2 . 3 + / - 1 . 2 , and average seizure duration was 39 . 5 + / - 8 . 4s .
Pre - treatment with a dose of 30 mg / kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75 % of the rats .
Lower doses ( 3 and 10mg / kg ) did not suppress seizures , however , after administration of 10mg / kg , significant reductions in seizures duration ( 24 . 3 + / - 6 . 8s ) and seizure number ( 1 . 6 + / - 0 . 34 ) were found .
No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral / EEG patterns studied , including sleep / wakefulness cycle , at the doses studied .
