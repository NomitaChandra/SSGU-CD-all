Histamine antagonists and d - tubocurarine - induced hypotension in cardiac surgical patients .
Hemodynamic effects and histamine release by bolus injection of 0 . 35 mg / kg of d - tubocurarine were studied in 24 patients .
H1 - and H2 - histamine antagonists or placebo were given before dosing with d - tubocurarine in a randomized double - blind fashion to four groups : group 1 - - placebo ; group 2 - - cimetidine , 4 mg / kg , plus placebo ; group 3 - - chlorpheniramine , 0 . 1 mg / kg , plus placebo ; and group 4 - - cimetidine plus chlorpheniramine .
Histamine release occurred in most patients , the highest level 2 minutes after d - tubocurarine dosing .
Group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma histamine change and systemic vascular resistance ( r = 0 . 58 ; P less than 0 . 05 ) not present in group 4 .
Prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resistance .
These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with d - tubocurarine dosing are only partially explained by histamine release .
Thus prior dosing with H1 - and H2 - antagonists provides only partial protection .
