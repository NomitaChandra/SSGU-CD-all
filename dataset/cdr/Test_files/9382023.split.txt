Hypertensive response during dobutamine stress echocardiography.
Among 3,129 dobutamine stress echocardiographic studies, a hypertensive response, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP > or = 110 mm Hg, occurred in 30 patients (1%).
Patients with this response more often had a history of hypertension and had higher resting systolic and diastolic BP before dobutamine infusion.
