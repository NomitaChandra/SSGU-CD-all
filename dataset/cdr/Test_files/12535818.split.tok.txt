Amiodarone and the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and prior myocardial infarction .
OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker .
BACKGROUND : Reports of severe bradyarrhythmia during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy 's use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias .
METHODS : A study cohort of 8 , 770 patients age > or = 65 years with a new diagnosis of AF was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a myocardial infarction ( MI ) between 1991 and 1999 .
Using a nested case - control design , 477 cases of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched ( 1 : 4 ) to 1 , 908 controls .
Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR ) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use , controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol , Class I antiarrhythmic agents , beta - blockers , calcium channel blockers , and digoxin .
RESULTS : amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR : 2 . 14 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1 . 30 to 3 . 54 ) .
This effect was modified by gender , with a greater risk in women versus men ( OR : 3 . 86 , 95 % CI : 1 . 70 to 8 . 75 vs . OR : 1 . 52 , 95 % CI : 0 . 80 to 2 . 89 ) .
Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR : 1 . 78 , 95 % CI : 1 . 37 to 2 . 31 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker .
The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving amiodarone requires further investigation .
