Mefenamic acid-induced neutropenia and renal failure in elderly females with hypothyroidism.
We report mefenamic acid-induced non-oliguric renal failure and severe neutropenia occurring simultaneously in two elderly females.
The neutropenia was due to maturation arrest of the myeloid series in one patient.
Both patients were also hypothyroid, but it is not clear whether this was a predisposing factor to the development of these adverse reactions.
However, it would seem prudent not to use mefenamic acid in hypothyroid patients until the hypothyroidism has been corrected.
