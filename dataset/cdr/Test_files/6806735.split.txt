Treatment of ovarian cancer with a combination of cis-platinum, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and hexamethylmelamine.
During the last 2 1/2 years, 38 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of cisplatinum (CPDD), 50 mg/m2, adriamycin, 30 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2, on day 1; and hexamethylmelamine (HMM), 6 mg/kg daily, for 14 days.
Each course was repeated monthly.
2 patients had stage II, 14 stage III and 22 stage IV disease.
14 of the 38 patients were previously treated with chemotherapy, 1 with radiation, 6 with both chemotherapy and radiation, and 17 did not have any treatment before CPDD combination.
31 of the 38 cases (81.5%) demonstrated objective responses lasting for 2 months or more.
These responses were partial in 19 and complete in 12 cases.
Hematologic toxicity was moderate and with reversible anemia developing in 71% of patients.
Gastrointestinal side effects from CPDD were universal.
HMM gastrointestinal toxicity necessitated discontinuation of the drug in 5 patients.
Severe nephrotoxicity was observed in 2 patients but was reversible.
There were no drug-related deaths.
