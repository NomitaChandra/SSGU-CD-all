Total intravenous anesthesia with etomidate .
III .
Some observations in adults .
An investigation was undertaken to determine the dosage of etomidate required to maintain sleep in adults undergoing surgery under regional local anesthesia .
Premedication of diazepam 10 mg and atropine 0 . 5 mg was given , and sleep was induced and maintained by intermittent intravenous injections of etomidate 0 . 1 / mg / kg , given whenever the patient would open his eyes on request .
A mean overall dose of etomidate 17 . 4 microgram / kg / min .
was required to maintain sleep , but great individual variation occurred , with older patients requiring less drug .
The investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side - effects , particularly pain and myoclonia , which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cases .
It is considered unlikely that etomidate will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of myoclonia after prolonged administration .
In several patients uncontrollable muscle movements persisted for many minutes after complete recovery of consciousness .
