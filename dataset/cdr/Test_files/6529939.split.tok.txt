Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block induced by propranolol .
Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial ( S - A ) block was observed in a 57 - year - old woman , under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily .
The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P - P intervals and occasional pauses .
These pauses were always preceded by the short P - P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P - P intervals of 0 . 92 - 0 . 95 s representing the basic sinus cycle .
Following these basic sinus cycles , alternating rhythm started with the longer P - P interval .
The long P - P intervals ranged between 1 . 04 - 1 . 12 s and the short P - P intervals between 0 . 80 - 0 . 84 s , respectively .
The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P - P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle .
In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2 / 1 S - A block was observed .
This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P - P interval starting the alternative rhythm .
There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P - R intervals .
S - A conduction through two pathways , the first with 2 / 1 block the second having 0 . 12 - 0 . 14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2 / 1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P - P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen .
Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P - P intervals without changing the rhythm .
The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2 / 1 S - A block was seen .
This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder .
