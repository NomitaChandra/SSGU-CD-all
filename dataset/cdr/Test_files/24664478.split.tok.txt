Nelarabine neurotoxicity with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy : Case report and review of literature .
Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal ( IT ) chemotherapy is reported .
A 37 - year - old Caucasian woman with a history of T - cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease .
She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant .
She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement .
She was re - induced with nelarabine 1500 mg / m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 3 , and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system ( CNS ) prophylaxis .
At the time of treatment , she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) .
She tolerated therapy well , entered a complete remission , and recovered her renal function .
She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later .
A week after this second cycle , she noted numbness in her lower extremities .
Predominantly sensory , though also motor and autonomic , peripheral neuropathy started in her feet , ascended proximally to the mid - thoracic region , and eventually included her distal upper extremities .
A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of her spine demonstrated changes from C2 to C6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration .
Nelarabine was felt to be the cause of her symptoms .
Her neuropathy stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated , reduced - intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission , but relapsed disease 10 weeks later .
She is currently being treated with best supportive care .
To our knowledge , this is the first published case report of severe neurotoxicity caused by nelarabine in a patient who received concurrent IT chemotherapy .
