Effect of methoxamine on maximum urethral pressure in women with genuine stress incontinence : a placebo - controlled , double - blind crossover study .
The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1 - adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence .
A randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover study design was employed .
Half log incremental doses of intravenous methoxamine or placebo ( saline ) were administered to a group of women with genuine stress incontinence while measuring maximum urethral pressure ( MUP ) , blood pressure , heart rate , and symptomatic side effects .
Methoxamine evoked non - significant increases in MUP and diastolic blood pressure but caused a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage .
Systemic side effects including piloerection , headache , and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects .
The results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct , peripherally acting sub - type - selective alpha1 - adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of stress incontinence may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects .
