Myoclonus associated with lorazepam therapy in very-low-birth-weight infants.
Lorazepam is being used with increasing frequency as a sedative in the newborn and the young infant.
Concern has been raised with regard to the safety of lorazepam in this age group, especially in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW; < 1,500 g) infants.
Three young infants, all of birth weight < 1,500 g, experienced myoclonus following the intravenous administration of lorazepam.
The potential neurotoxic effects of the drug (and its vehicle) in this population are discussed.
Injectable lorazepam should be used with caution in VLBW infants.
