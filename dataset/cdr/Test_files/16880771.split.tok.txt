Tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjects .
Endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning .
Administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients .
Because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission , the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved .
We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning .
Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled design .
Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine - receptor agonist pergolide ( 0 . 1 mg ) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day .
The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo .
This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow - up 4 weeks post - training .
Subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group .
The extent of ' flattened ' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition .
These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals .
Thus , phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients .
