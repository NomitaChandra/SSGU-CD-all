Flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications.
STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication.
DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine.
Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP.
Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded.
INTERVENTIONS: Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam.
RESULTS: In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle.
This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death.
Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle.
Animals became somnolent and none died.
Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil.
Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration.
In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously.
This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death.
Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil.
This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4.
Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil.
This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4.
CONCLUSION: Flumazenil can unmask seizures and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined cocaine-diazepam intoxications.
