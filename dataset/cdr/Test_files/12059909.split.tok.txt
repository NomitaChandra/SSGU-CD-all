Delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder of DBA / 2 and C57BL / 6 female mouse .
The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice ( DBA / 2 ) but not in a resistant strain ( C57BL / 6 ) when both were treated with a single 300 mg / kg dose of cyclophosphamide ( CY ) .
Inbred DBA / 2 and C57BL / 6 female mice were injected with CY , and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures , and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy .
Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7 - 10 days .
After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non - ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86 % of DBA / 2 mice but only in 4 % of C57BL / 6 mice .
Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium .
Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA / 2 mice than in C57BL / 6 mice or untreated controls .
Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells .
Instead , numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers .
Delayed cystitis still persisted in DBA / 2 mice 100 days after treatment .
These results indicate that delayed toxicity of CY in female DBA / 2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL / 6 mice .
This pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease .
