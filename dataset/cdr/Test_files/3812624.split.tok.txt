Two cases of downbeat nystagmus and oscillopsia associated with carbamazepine .
Downbeat nystagmus is often associated with structural lesions at the craniocervical junction , but has occasionally been reported as a manifestation of metabolic imbalance or drug intoxication .
We recorded the eye movements of two patients with reversible downbeat nystagmus related to carbamazepine therapy .
The nystagmus of both patients resolved after reduction of the serum carbamazepine levels .
Neuroradiologic investigations including magnetic resonance imaging scans in both patients showed no evidence of intracranial abnormality .
In patients with downbeat nystagmus who are taking anticonvulsant medications , consideration should be given to reduction in dose before further investigation is undertaken .
