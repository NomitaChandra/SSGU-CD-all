Comparison of the effect of oxitropium bromide and of slow - release theophylline on nocturnal asthma .
The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug , oxitropium bromide , and of a slow - release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo - controlled double - blind study .
Two samples were studied : 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms ( 6 subjects ) or at 400 micrograms t . i . d .
( 6 subjects ) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b . i . d .
Morning dipping , assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight , was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken , whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration .
No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug , as well as with either dosage of oxitropium .
No subject reported side effects of oxitropium , as compared to three subjects reporting nausea , vomiting and tremors after theophylline .
Oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma , since it is equally potent , safer and does not require the titration of dosage .
