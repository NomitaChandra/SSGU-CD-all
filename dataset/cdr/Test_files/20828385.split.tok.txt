Cytostatic and anti - angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma .
Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) is a rare and aggressive type of B - cell non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy , and their prognosis is poor .
However , a 38 % remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus , a mTOR inhibitor . Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment , and a progression - free survival of 10 months .
In this case , lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy .
Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest , but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells .
Apart from this cytostatic effect , temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression .
Moreover , numerous patchy , well - limited fibrotic areas , compatible with post - necrotic tissue repair , were found after 6 - month temsirolimus therapy .
Thus , temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti - angiogenic effects . This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy .
