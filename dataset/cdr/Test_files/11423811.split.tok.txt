A pilot study to assess the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of cocaine - associated chest pain .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma .
Dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE ) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia .
Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use , we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine - associated chest pain .
METHODS : A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary - care teaching hospital .
Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level .
Patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study .
All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit .
RESULTS : Twenty - four patients were enrolled .
Two patients had inadequate resting images , one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis , another DSE was terminated because of a rate - related atrial conduction deficit , and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate .
Thus , 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates .
None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response , which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias ( excluding sinus tachycardia ) .
Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response , 13 ( 65 % ) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates .
CONCLUSION : No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine - related chest pain .
