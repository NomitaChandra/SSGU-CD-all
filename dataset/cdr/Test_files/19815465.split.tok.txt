Binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin .
This study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin ( VGB ) .
Two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy ( current , previous , or no exposure to VGB ) .
Groups were matched with respect to age , gender , and seizure frequency .
All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function ( wide - field multifocal electroretinography ) and conventional visual field testing ( static perimetry ) .
Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59 % of patients currently taking VGB , 43 % of patients who previously took VGB , and 24 % of patients with no exposure to VGB .
Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48 % of current VGB users and 22 % of prior VGB users , but in none of the patients without previous exposure to VGB .
Bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population , irrespective of drug history .
Assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify retinal toxicity associated with VGB .
