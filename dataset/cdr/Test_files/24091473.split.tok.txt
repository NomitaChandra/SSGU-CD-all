Resuscitation with lipid , epinephrine , or both in levobupivacaine - induced cardiac toxicity in newborn piglets .
BACKGROUND : The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion , epinephrine , or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity ( LAST ) .
METHODS : Newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred .
Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia , fibrillation , or QRS prolongation .
Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups : control ( saline ) , Intralipid ( ) alone , epinephrine alone , or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine .
Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min .
RESULTS : ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets .
Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups , but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control .
The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group , but 14 and 17 , respectively , in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine , or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST .
Epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone .
