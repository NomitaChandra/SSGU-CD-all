Treatment of compensatory gustatory hyperhidrosis with topical glycopyrrolate .
Gustatory hyperhidrosis is facial sweating usually associated with the eating of hot spicy food or even smelling this food .
Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs , the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride , and the injection of botulinum toxin .
Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1 . 5 % or 2 % topical glycopyrrolate .
All patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis , which interfered with their social activities , after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy , and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis .
After applying topical glycopyrrolate , the subjective effect was excellent ( no sweating after eating hot spicy food ) in 10 patients ( 77 % ) , and fair ( clearly reduced sweating ) in 3 patients ( 23 % ) .
All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods .
Adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients ( 2 % glycopyrrolate ) , a light headache in 1 patient ( 1 . 5 % glycopyrrolate ) .
The topical application of a glycopyrrolate pad appeared to be safe , efficacious , well tolerated , and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of gustatory hyperhidrosis in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients , with few side effects .
