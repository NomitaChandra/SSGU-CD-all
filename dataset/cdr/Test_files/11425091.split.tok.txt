Prenatal cocaine exposure and cranial sonographic findings in preterm infants .
PURPOSE : Prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked with subependymal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term .
We sought to determine if prenatal cocaine exposure increases the incidence of subependymal cysts in preterm infants .
METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1 - year period on 122 premature ( < 36 weeks of gestation ) infants .
Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups : those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine .
Infants were assigned to the cocaine - exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery .
RESULTS : Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories .
The incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14 % ( 16 of 117 ) .
The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44 % ( 8 of 18 ) compared with 8 % ( 8 of 99 ) in the unexposed group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally .
This result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants .
