Acute interstitial nephritis due to nicergoline ( Sermion ) .
We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis ( AIN ) due to nicergoline ( Sermion ) .
A 50 - year - old patient admitted to our hospital for fever and acute renal failure .
Before admission , he had been taking nicergoline and bendazac lysine due to retinal vein occlusion at ophthalmologic department .
Thereafter , he experienced intermittent fever and skin rash .
On admission , clinical symptoms ( i . e . arthralgia and fever ) and laboratory findings ( i . e . eosinophilia and renal failure ) suggested AIN , and which was confirmed by pathologic findings on renal biopsy .
A lymphocyte transformation test demonstrated a positive result against nicergoline .
Treatment was consisted of withdrawal of nicergoline and intravenous methylprednisolone , and his renal function was completely recovered .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of nicergoline - associated AIN .
