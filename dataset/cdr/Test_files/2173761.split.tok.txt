Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs .
The effects of i . v .
bolus administration of cromakalim ( 1 - 10 micrograms / kg ) and pinacidil ( 3 - 100 micrograms / kg ) on large ( circumflex artery ) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin ( 0 . 03 - 10 micrograms / kg ) .
Nitroglycerin , up to 0 . 3 micrograms / kg , selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( CxAD ) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter .
In contrast , cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0 . 3 micrograms / kg simultaneously and dose - dependently increased CxAD , coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure .
Cromakalim was approximately 8 - to 9 . 5 - fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD .
Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug - induced tachycardia was abolished .
When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant , the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim ( 10 micrograms / kg ) , pinacidil ( 30 micrograms / kg ) and nitroglycerin ( 10 micrograms / kg ) were reduced by 68 + / - 7 , 54 + / - 9 and 1 + / - 1 % , respectively .
Thus , whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow - independently dilates large coronary arteries , cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors - mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand .
Finally , two mechanisms at least , direct vasodilation and flow dependency , are involved in the cromakalim - and pinacidil - induced increase in CxAD .
