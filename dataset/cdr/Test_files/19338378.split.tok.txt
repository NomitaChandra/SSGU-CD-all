Reducing harm associated with anticoagulation : practical considerations of argatroban therapy in heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
Argatroban is a hepatically metabolized , direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) and for patients with or at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT .
The US FDA - recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg / kg / min ( reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients ) , adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs ) 1 . 5 - 3 times baseline ( not > 100 seconds ) .
Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion , e . g .
heart failure , yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction , adult age , sex , race / ethnicity or obesity .
Argatroban 0 . 5 - 1 . 2 microg / kg / min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs .
The FDA - recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg / kg / min ( 350 microg / kg initial bolus ) , adjusted to achieve activated clotting times ( ACTs ) of 300 - 450 sec .
For PCI , argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients ; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age , sex , race / ethnicity or obesity , and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibition .
Argatroban prolongs the International Normalized Ratio , and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban - to - warfarin transition should be followed .
Major bleeding with argatroban is 0 - 10 % in the non - interventional setting and 0 - 5 . 8 % periprocedurally .
Argatroban has no specific antidote , and if excessive anticoagulation occurs , argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced .
Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in HIT , including in special populations and during PCI , may facilitate reduction of harm associated with HIT ( e . g . fewer thromboses ) or its treatment ( e . g . fewer argatroban medication errors ) .
