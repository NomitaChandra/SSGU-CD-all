Synthesis and preliminary pharmacological investigations of 1 - ( 1 , 2 - dihydro - 2 - acenaphthylenyl ) piperazine derivatives as potential atypical antipsychotic agents in mice .
In research towards the development of new atypical antipsychotic agents , one strategy is that the dopaminergic system can be modulated through manipulation of the serotonergic system .
The synthesis and preliminary pharmacological evaluation of a series of potential atypical antipsychotic agents based on the structure of 1 - ( 1 , 2 - dihydro - 2 - acenaphthylenyl ) piperazine ( 7 ) is described .
Compound 7e , 5 - { 2 - [ 4 - ( 1 , 2 - dihydro - 2 - acenaphthylenyl ) piperazinyl ] ethyl } - 2 , 3 - dihy dro - 1H - indol - 2 - one , from this series showed significant affinities at the 5 - HT1A and 5 - HT2A receptors and moderate affinity at the D2 receptor .
7e exhibits a high reversal of catalepsy induced by haloperidol indicating its atypical antipsychotic nature .
