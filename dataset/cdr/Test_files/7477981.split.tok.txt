Levodopa - induced dyskinesias are improved by fluoxetine .
We evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa - responsive patients with Parkinson 's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist , apomorphine , before and after the administration of fluoxetine ( 20 mg twice per day ) for 11 + / - 1 days .
After fluoxetine treatment , there was a significant 47 % improvement ( p < 0 . 05 ) of apomorphine - induced dyskinesias without modification of parkinsonian motor disability .
The dyskinesias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic dyskinesias ( onset - and end - of - dose dyskinesias ) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid - dose dyskinesias .
The results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce levodopa - or dopamine agonist - induced dyskinesias without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability .
