Lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy after steroid injection at lateral epicondyle .
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy ( LACNP ) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40 - year - old woman .
MATERIAL AND METHOD : A 40 - year - old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm ; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before .
Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area .
RESULTS : The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( LACN ) ( 6 . 2 uV ) was lower than that of the left ( 13 . 1 uV ) .
The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50 % reduction .
She was diagnosed with right LACNP ( mainly axonal involvement ) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings .
Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree .
CONCLUSION : This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis .
An electrodiagnostic study , including a nerve conduction study of the LACN , was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle .
