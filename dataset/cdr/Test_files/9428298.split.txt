Continuously nebulized albuterol in severe exacerbations of asthma in adults: a case-controlled study.
A retrospective, case-controlled analysis comparing patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit with severe exacerbations of asthma who received continuously nebulized albuterol (CNA) versus intermittent albuterol (INA) treatments is reported.
Forty matched pairs of patients with asthma are compared.
CNA was administered for a mean of 11 +/- 10 hr.
The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was similar between groups.
Symptomatic hypokalemia did not occur.
CNA patients had higher heart rates during treatment, which may reflect severity of illness.
The incidence of intubation was similar.
We conclude that CNA and INA demonstrated similar profiles with regard to safety, morbidity, and mortality.
