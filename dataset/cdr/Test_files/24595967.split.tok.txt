Dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ecstasy users .
Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation .
Previous studies indicate that ecstasy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep - related impairments .
We extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy users ( n = 12 ) and drug naive healthy controls ( n = 26 ) .
Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep , with and without interference prior to testing .
In addition , we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning , memory and executive functioning .
Ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation , a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference .
Additionally , ecstasy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry , in the domains of proactive interference memory , long - term memory , encoding , working memory and complex planning .
We suggest that ecstasy - associated dysfunction in fronto - temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ecstasy users .
