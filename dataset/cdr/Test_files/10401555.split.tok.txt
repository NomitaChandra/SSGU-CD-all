Nociceptin / orphanin FQ and nocistatin on learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine in mice .
1 . Nociceptin , also known as orphanin FQ , is an endogenous ligand for the orphan opioid receptor - like receptor 1 ( ORL1 ) and involves in various functions in the central nervous system ( CNS ) .
On the other hand , nocistatin is recently isolated from the same precursor as nociceptin and blocks nociceptin - induced allodynia and hyperalgesia .
2 .
Although ORL1 receptors which display a high degree of sequence homology with classical opioid receptors are abundant in the hippocampus , little is known regarding their role in learning and memory .
3 .
The present study was designed to investigate whether nociceptin / orphanin FQ and nocistatin could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist , using spontaneous alternation of Y - maze and step - down type passive avoidance tasks in mice .
4 .
While nocistatin ( 0 . 5 - 5 . 0 nmol mouse - 1 , i . c . v . ) administered 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task , had no effect on spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance behaviours , a lower per cent alternation and shorter median step - down latency in the retention test were obtained in nociceptin ( 1 . 5 and / or 5 . 0 nmol mouse - 1 , i . c . v . ) - treated normal mice .
5 .
Administration of nocistatin ( 1 . 5 and / or 5 . 0 nmol mouse - 1 , i . c . v . ) 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task , attenuated the scopolamine - induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviours .
6 .
These results indicated that nocistatin , a new biologically active peptide , ameliorates impairments of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance induced by scopolamine , and suggested that these peptides play opposite roles in learning and memory .
