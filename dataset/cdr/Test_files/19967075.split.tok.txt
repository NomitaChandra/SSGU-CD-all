Decreased Expression of Na / K - ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , AQP1 and OAT in Gentamicin - induced Nephropathy .
The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered regulation of tubular transporters in gentamicin - induced nephropathy .
Sprague - Dawley male rats ( 200~250 g ) were subcutaneously injected with gentamicin ( 100 mg / kg per day ) for 7 days , and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry .
The mRNA and protein expression of OAT was also determined .
Gentamicin - treated rats exhibited significantly decreased creatinine clearance along with increased plasma creatinine levels .
Accordingly , the fractional excretion of sodium increased .
Urine volume was increased , while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased .
Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , and AQP1 in the kidney of gentamicin - treated rats .
The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased .
Gentamicin - induced nephropathy may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , AQP1 and OAT .
