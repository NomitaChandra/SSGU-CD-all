Evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol - induced catalepsy .
Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic - induced catalepsy .
Large doses of the cholinomimetic , pilocarpine , could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked .
Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker , haloperidol .
A muscarinic receptor blocker , atropine , disrupted haloperidol - induced catalepsy .
Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine - synthesis inhibitor , hemicholinium , prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol .
These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems .
Alternatively , activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems .
