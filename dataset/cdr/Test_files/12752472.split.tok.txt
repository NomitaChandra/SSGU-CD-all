Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy .
PURPOSE : Apnea is known to occur during seizures , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few .
Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce .
Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine - induced epilepsy .
METHODS : Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given tracheotomies , and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions .
Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph .
This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a polygraph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , inspiratory time ( TI ) , expiratory time ( TE ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI ) on a breath - by - breath basis .
RESULTS : The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats .
Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals .
The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2 , followed by an increase in VE .
In the epileptic group , the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group .
Systemic application of KCN , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in VE for both groups .
CONCLUSIONS : The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined .
We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy - associated conditions .
