Hyperglycemic effect of amino compounds structurally related to caproate in rats.
The chronic feeding of small amounts (0.3-3% of diet weight) of certain amino derivatives of caproate resulted in hyperglycemia, an elevated glucose tolerance curve and, occasionally, glucosuria.
Effective compounds included norleucine, norvaline, glutamate, epsilon-aminocaproate, methionine, and leucine.
