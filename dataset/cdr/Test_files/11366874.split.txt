Viracept and irregular heartbeat warning.
A group of doctors in Boston warn that the protease inhibitor Viracept may cause an irregular heart beat, known as bradycardia, in people with HIV.
Bradycardia occurred in a 45-year-old male patient who was Viracept in combination with other anti-HIV drugs.
The symptoms ceased after switching to another drug combination.
