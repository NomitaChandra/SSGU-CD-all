Takotsubo syndrome ( or apical ballooning syndrome ) secondary to Zolmitriptan .
Takotsubo syndrome ( TS ) , also known as broken heart syndrome , is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome ( ie , ST - segment elevation , T wave inversions , and pathologic Q waves ) .
We report a case of 54 - year - old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines , who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1 / 2 mm ST - segment elevation in leads II , III , aVF , V5 , and V6 and positive troponin I .
Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS .
Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines .
But before this event , she was taking zolmitriptan 2 - 3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache .
She otherwise reported that she is quite active , rides horses , and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity .
There was no evidence of any recent stress or status migrainosus .
Extensive literature search revealed multiple cases of coronary artery vasospasm secondary to zolmitriptan , but none of the cases were associated with TS .
