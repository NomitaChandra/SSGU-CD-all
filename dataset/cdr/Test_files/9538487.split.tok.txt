Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma precipitated by lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .
A 45 - year - old man , with a 10 - year history of manic depression treated with lithium , was admitted with hyperosmolar , nonketotic coma .
He gave a five - year history of polyuria and polydipsia , during which time urinalysis had been negative for glucose .
After recovery from hyperglycaemia , he remained polyuric despite normal blood glucose concentrations ; water deprivation testing indicated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus , likely to be lithium - induced .
We hypothesize that when this man developed type 2 diabetes , chronic polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was sufficient to precipitate hyperosmolar dehydration .
