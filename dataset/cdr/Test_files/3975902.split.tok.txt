Cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ingestion .
Barium - supplemented Long - Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium ( 100 micrograms / ml mineral fortified water ) treatment .
Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability , contractility , and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium - induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system .
The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital .
Under barbiturate anesthesia , virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium - exposed rats relative to the corresponding control - fed rats .
The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium - treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic , and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response .
Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest , irrespective of the anesthetic employed .
The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium - treated rats relative to the control groups , irrespective of the anesthetic regimen .
Similarly , significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium - exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity .
In addition , the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium - exposed rats .
Overall , the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics , the myocardial metabolic disturbances , and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure .
These experimental findings represent the first indication that life - long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system .
