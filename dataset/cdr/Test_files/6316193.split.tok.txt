Structure - activity and dose - effect relationships of the antagonism of picrotoxin - induced seizures by cholecystokinin , fragments and analogues of cholecystokinin in mice .
Intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester ( CCK - 8 - SE ) and nonsulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide ( CCK - 8 - NS ) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in mice .
Experiments with N - and C - terminal fragments revealed that the C - terminal tetrapeptide ( CCK - 5 - 8 ) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule .
The analogues CCK - 8 - SE and CCK - 8 - NS ( dose range 0 . 2 - 6 . 4 mumol / kg ) and caerulein dose range 0 . 1 - 0 . 8 mumol / kg ) showed bell - shaped dose - effect curves , with the greatest maximum inhibition for CCK - 8 - NS .
The peptide CCK - 5 - 8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides , 3 . 2 mumol / kg and larger doses of the reference drug , diazepam , totally prevented picrotoxin - induced seizures and mortality .
The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam .
Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK - 5 - 8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta - alanyl derivatives of CCK - 5 - 8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK - 8 - SE .
Of the CCK - 2 - 8 analogues , Ser ( SO3H ) 7 - Ac - CCK - 2 - 8 - SE and Thr ( SO3H ) 7 - Ac - CCK - 2 - 8 - SE and Hyp ( SO3H ) - Ac - CCK - 2 - 8 - SE were slightly more active than CCK - 8 - SE .
