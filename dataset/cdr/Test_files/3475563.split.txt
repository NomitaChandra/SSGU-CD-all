Rechallenge of patients who developed oral candidiasis or hoarseness with beclomethasone dipropionate.
Of 158 asthmatic patients who were placed on inhaled beclomethasone, 15 (9.5%) developed either hoarseness (8), oral thrush (6), or both (1).
When their adverse reactions subsided, seven of these 15 patients were rechallenged with inhaled beclomethasone.
These included five cases who developed hoarseness and three who developed Candidiasis.
One patient had both.
Oral thrush did not recur, but 60% (3/5) of patients with hoarseness had recurrence.
We conclude that patients may be restarted on inhaled beclomethasone when clinically indicated; however, because of the high recurrence rate, patients who develop hoarseness should not be re-challenged.
Concomitant use of oral prednisone and topical beclomethasone may increase the risk of developing hoarseness or candidiasis.
