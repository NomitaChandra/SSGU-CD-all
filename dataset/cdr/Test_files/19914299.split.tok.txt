Fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5 - fluorouracil .
Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition .
A widely used chemotherapeutic agent , 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) , readily crosses the blood - brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function .
In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain .
In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine .
In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic ( two week ) treatment with 5 - FU and ( three weeks ) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5 - FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats .
Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test ( CER ) which showed that animals treated with 5 - FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls .
A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test , the object location recognition test ( OLR ) .
Animals treated only with 5 - FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance .
5 - FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls .
This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5 - FU .
Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour .
These findings suggest that 5 - FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine .
