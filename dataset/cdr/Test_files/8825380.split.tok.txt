The effect of recombinant human insulin - like growth factor - I on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats .
We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) nephropathy , an experimental model of glomerular disease .
Therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) IGF - I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy .
The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk .
Experimental animals ( n = 6 ) received rhIGF - I , 400 micrograms / d , whereas control rats ( n = 6 ) received the vehicle .
rhIGF - I improved weight gain by 14 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) , without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease .
Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF - I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy .
After 12 wk , the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF - I - treated rats , 0 . 48 + / - 0 . 08 versus 0 . 24 + / - 0 . 06 mL / min / 100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals , p < 0 . 05 .
The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis , tubulointerstitial injury , or renal cortical malondialdehyde content .
In rats with PAN nephropathy , administration of rhIGF - I increased IGF - I and GH receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of IGF - I receptor mRNA .
In normal rats with intact kidneys , rhIGF - I administration ( n = 4 ) did not alter weight gain , blood pressure , proteinuria , GFR , glomerular planar area , renal cortical malondialdehyde content , or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage , compared with untreated animals ( n = 4 ) .
rhIGF - I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF - I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF - I or GH receptors .
We conclude that : 1 ) administration of rhIGF - I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2 ) unlike rhGH , long - term use of rhIGF - I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model .
