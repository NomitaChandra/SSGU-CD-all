Evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in the rat .
Male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4 ( 50 mg / kg ) 7 days prior to injection of D - amphetamine ( 10 or 40 mumol / kg i . p . ) .
The hyperactivity induced by D - amphetamine ( 10 mumol / kg ) was significantly reduced by DSP4 pretreatment .
However , the increased rearings and the amphetamine - induced stereotypies were not blocked by pretreatment with DSP4 .
The reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by DSP4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline - uptake blocking agent , desipramine , which prevents the neurotoxic action of DSP4 .
The present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat .
