Hepatitis and renal tubular acidosis after anesthesia with methoxyflurane.
A 69-year-old man operated for acute cholecystitis under methoxyflurane anesthesia developed postoperatively a hepatic insufficiency syndrome and renal tubular acidosis.
Massive bleeding appeared during surgery which lasted for six hours.
Postoperative evolution under supportive therapy was favourable.
Complete recovery was confirmed by repeated controls performed over a period of one year after surgery.
