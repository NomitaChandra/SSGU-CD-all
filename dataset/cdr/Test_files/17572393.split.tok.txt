Neuroprotective effects of melatonin upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of BCNU - induced cortical dysplasia .
Cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation , migration and maturation .
This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine - [ 1 , 3 - bis ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 1 - nitrosoure ] ( BCNU ) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU - induced cortical dysplasia , using histological and biochemical analyses .
Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups : intact - control , saline - control , melatonin - treated , BCNU - exposed and BCNU - exposed plus melatonin .
Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery .
Immuno / histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum , and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined .
Histopathologically , typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups , but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU - exposed cortical dysplasia group .
There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU - exposed group , but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein , synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed , indicating a delayed maturation , and melatonin significantly reversed these changes .
Malondialdehyde level in BCNU - exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group ( P < 0 . 01 ) , while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups .
These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU .
