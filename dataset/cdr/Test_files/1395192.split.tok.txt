Recurrent myocardial infarction in a postpartum patient receiving bromocriptine .
Myocardial infarction in puerperium is infrequently reported .
Spasm , coronary dissection , or atheromatous etiology has been described .
Bromocriptine has been implicated in several previous case reports of myocardial infarction in the puerperium .
Our case ( including an inadvertent rechallenge ) suggests such a relationship .
Although generally regarded as " safe , " possible serious cardiac effects of bromocriptine should be acknowledged .
