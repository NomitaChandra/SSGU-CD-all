Acute hepatitis associated with clopidogrel: a case report and review of the literature.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a common cause of acute hepatitis, and the recognition of the responsible drug may be difficult.
We describe a case of clopidogrel-related acute hepatitis.
The diagnosis is strongly suggested by an accurate medical history and liver biopsy.
Reports about cases of hepatotoxicity due to clopidogrel are increasing in the last few years, after the increased use of this drug.
In conclusion, we believe that physicians should carefully consider the risk of drug-induced hepatic injury when clopidogrel is prescribed.
