Central action of narcotic analgesics .
Part IV .
Noradrenergic influences on the activity of analgesics in rats .
The effect of clonidine , naphazoline and xylometazoline on analgesia induced by morphine , codeine , fentanyl and pentazocine , and on cataleptic effect of morphine , codine and fentanyl was studied in rats .
The biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline ( NA ) were also performed .
It was found that three drugs stimulating central NA receptors failed to affect the analgesic ED50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl .
Codeine catalepsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by naphazoline and xylometazoline .
The brain concentration of NA was not changed by morphine and fentanyl , but one of the doses of codeine ( 45 mg / kg ) slightly enhanced it .
Pentazocine dose - dependently decreased the brain level of NA .
The rate of NA turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl ( 0 . 2 mg / kg ) following which the disappearance of NA from the brain was diminished .
The results are discussed in the light of various and non - uniform data from the literature .
It is suggested that in rats the brain NA plays a less important function than the other monoamines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics .
