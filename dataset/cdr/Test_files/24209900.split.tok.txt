Ifosfamide related encephalopathy : the need for a timely EEG evaluation .
BACKGROUND : Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas , lymphoma , gynecologic and testicular cancers .
Encephalopathy has been reported in 10 - 40 % of patients receiving high - dose IV ifosfamide .
OBJECTIVE : To highlight the role of electroencephalogram ( EEG ) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy .
METHODS : Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients , admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center between years 2009 and 2012 , who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy .
RESULTS : All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after ( within 12 h - 2 days ) receiving ifosfamide .
Two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non - convulsive status epilepticus ( NCSE ) that required ICU admission and intubation .
Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients ; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing .
Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted .
Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement .
CONCLUSIONS : Severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with EEG changes .
We suggest a timely EEG evaluation for patients receiving ifosfamide who develop features of encephalopathy .
