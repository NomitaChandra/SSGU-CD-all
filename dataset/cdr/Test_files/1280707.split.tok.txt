Progesterone potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in pentobarbital - anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures .
The effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined .
After determining the bupivacaine AD50 ( the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50 % of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic ) , we determined the effect of 1 - hour progesterone HCl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm .
Each concentration of progesterone ( 6 . 25 , 12 . 5 , 25 , and 50 micrograms / ml ) caused a significant and concentration - dependent reduction in the AD50 for bupivacaine .
Estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures , but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone .
Neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine .
Chronic progesterone pretreatment ( 5 mg / kg / day for 21 days ) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital - anesthetized rats .
There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone - treated rats ( 6 . 2 + / - 1 . 3 vs . 30 . 8 + / - 2 . 5 min , mean + / - SE ) .
The results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro .
Potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmia in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level .
