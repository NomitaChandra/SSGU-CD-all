Effects of a new calcium antagonist , CD - 832 , on isoproterenol - induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis .
Effects of CD - 832 on isoproterenol ( ISO ) - induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem .
In the presence of coronary artery stenosis , 3 - min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion ( 10 ng / kg / min ) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise , which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST - segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram .
After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed , equihypotensive doses of CD - 832 ( 3 and 10 micrograms / kg / min , n = 7 ) , nifedipine ( 1 and 3 micrograms / kg / min , n = 9 ) or diltiazem ( 10 and 30 micrograms / kg / min , n = 7 ) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion .
Both CD - 832 and diltiazem , but not nifedipine , significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion .
In contrast to nifedipine , CD - 832 ( 10 micrograms / kg / min ) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 + / - 12 % to 115 + / - 26 % of the control value ( P < . 01 ) and ST - segment elevation from 5 . 6 + / - 1 . 0 mV to 1 . 6 + / - 1 . 3 mV ( P < . 01 ) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis .
Diltiazem ( 30 micrograms / kg / min ) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 + / - 14 % to 63 + / - 18 % of the control value ( P < . 05 ) and ST - segment elevation from 4 . 7 + / - 0 . 7 mV to 2 . 1 + / - 0 . 7 mV ( P < . 01 ) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis .
These data show that CD - 832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD - 832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD - 832 .
