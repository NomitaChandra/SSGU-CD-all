A comparison of glyceryl trinitrate with diclofenac for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea : an open , randomized , cross - over trial .
Primary dysmenorrhea is a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins ; non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment .
However , in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of nitric oxide ( NO ) .
The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) , an NO donor , in the resolution of primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with diclofenac ( DCF ) .
A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary dysmenorrhea were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles .
In an open , cross - over , controlled design , patients were randomized to receive either DCF per os or GTN patches the first days of menses , when menstrual cramps became unendurable .
In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used .
Patients received up to 3 doses / day of 50 mg DCF or 2 . 5 mg / 24 h transdermal GTN for the first 3 days of the cycle , according to their needs .
The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side - effects at different times ( 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 minutes ) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle , with both drugs .
The difference in pain intensity score ( DPI ) was the main outcome variable .
Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute ( GTN , - 12 . 8 + / - 17 . 9 ; DCF , - 18 . 9 + / - 16 . 6 ) .
However , DCF continued to be effective in reducing pelvic pain for two hours , whereas GTN scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC ( after one hour : GTN , - 12 . 8 + / - 17 . 9 ; DFC , - 18 . 9 + / - 16 . 6 and after two hours : GTN , - 23 . 7 + / - 20 . 5 ; DFC , - 59 . 7 + / - 17 . 9 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
Low back pain was also relieved by both drugs .
Headache was significantly increased by GTN but not by DCF .
Eight patients stopped using GTN because headache - - attributed to its use - - became intolerable .
These findings indicate that GTN has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with DCF in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea .
