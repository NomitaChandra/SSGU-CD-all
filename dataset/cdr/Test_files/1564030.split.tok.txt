Mania associated with fluoxetine treatment in adolescents .
Fluoxetine , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of adolescent depression .
Generally safe and well tolerated by adults , fluoxetine has been reported to induce mania .
The cases of five depressed adolescents , 14 - 16 years of age , who developed mania during pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine , are reported here .
Apparent risk factors for the development of mania or hypomania during fluoxetine pharmacotherapy in this population were the combination of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder and affective instability ; major depression with psychotic features ; a family history of affective disorder , especially bipolar disorder ; and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
Further study is needed to determine the optimal dosage and to identify risk factors that increase individual vulnerability to fluoxetine induced mania in adolescents .
