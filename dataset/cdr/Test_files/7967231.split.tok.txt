Pharmacological studies on a new dihydrothienopyridine calcium antagonist , S - 312 - d .
5th communication : anticonvulsant effects in mice .
S - 312 , S - 312 - d , but not S - 312 - l , L - type calcium channel antagonists , showed anticonvulsant effects on the audiogenic tonic convulsions in DBA / 2 mice ; and their ED50 values were 18 . 4 ( 12 . 8 - 27 . 1 ) mg / kg , p . o .
and 15 . 0 ( 10 . 2 - 23 . 7 ) mg / kg , p . o . , respectively , while that of flunarizine was 34 . 0 ( 26 . 0 - 44 . 8 ) mg / kg , p . o .
Although moderate anticonvulsant effects of S - 312 - d in higher doses were observed against the clonic convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole ( 85 mg / kg , s . c . ) or bemegride ( 40 mg / kg , s . c . ) , no effects were observed in convulsions induced by N - methyl - D - aspartate , picrotoxin , or electroshock in Slc : ddY mice .
S - 312 - d may be useful in the therapy of certain types of human epilepsy .
