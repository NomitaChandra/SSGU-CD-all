The negative mucosal potential : separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man .
OBJECTIVE : We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain - related signal ( chemo - somatosensory evoked potential , CSSEP ) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal ( negative mucosal potential , NMP ) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs .
For this purpose , experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms .
METHODS : According to a double - blind , randomised , controlled , threefold cross - over design , 18 healthy subjects ( 11 males , 7 females ; mean age 26 years ) received either placebo , 400 mg ibuprofen , or 800 mg ibuprofen .
Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa ( stimulus duration 500 ms , interval approximately 60 s ) , and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature , humidity and flow rate ( 22 degrees C , 0 % relative humidity , 145 ml . s - 1 ) .
Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli .
Additionally , the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales .
RESULTS : As described earlier , administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but - relative to placebo - an increase in correlates of phasic pain , indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions .
Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP , it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery .
By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception , it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID .
The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain - related activity directly using a non - invasive technique in humans .
