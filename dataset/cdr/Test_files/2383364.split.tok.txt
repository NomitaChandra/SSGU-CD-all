Patient tolerance study of topical chlorhexidine diphosphanilate : a new topical agent for burns .
Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients .
Chlorhexidine phosphanilate ( CHP ) , a new broad - spectrum antimicrobial agent , has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form , but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application .
This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy .
Twenty - nine burn patients , each with two similar burns which could be separately treated , were given pairs of treatments at successive 12 - h intervals over a 3 - day period .
One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations , from 0 . 25 per cent to 2 per cent , their vehicle , and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine ( AgSD ) cream , an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds .
The other site was always treated with AgSD cream .
There was a direct relationship between CHP concentration and patients ' ratings of pain on an analogue scale .
The 0 . 25 per cent CHP cream was closest to AgSD in pain tolerance ; however , none of the treatments differed statistically from AgSD or from each other .
In addition , ease of application of CHP creams was less satisfactory than that of AgSD .
It was concluded that formulations at or below 0 . 5 per cent CHP may prove acceptable for wound care , but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use .
