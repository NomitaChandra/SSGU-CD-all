Pubertal exposure to Bisphenol A increases anxiety-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice.
The negative effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in anxiety-like behavior.
This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following BPA exposure during puberty.
On postnatal day (PND) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg BPA/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days.
On PND71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light/dark test.
In addition, AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus.
Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that anxiety-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to BPA.
AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with BPA compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum.
Our findings showed that pubertal BPA exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice.
Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced anxiety-like behaviors.
