Protective effect of Terminalia chebula against experimental myocardial injury induced by isoproterenol .
Cardioprotective effect of ethanolic extract of Terminalia chebula fruits ( 500 mg / kg body wt ) was examined in isoproterenol ( 200 mg / kg body wt ) induced myocardial damage in rats .
In isoproterenol administered rats , the level of lipid peroxides increased significantly in the serum and heart .
A significant decrease was observed in the activity of the myocardial marker enzymes with a concomitant increase in their activity in serum .
Histopathological examination was carried out to confirm the myocardial necrosis .
T . chebula extract pretreatment was found to ameliorate the effect of isoproterenol on lipid peroxide formation and retained the activities of the diagnostic marker enzymes .
