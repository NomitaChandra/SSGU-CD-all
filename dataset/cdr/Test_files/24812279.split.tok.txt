P53 inhibition exacerbates late - stage anthracycline cardiotoxicity .
AIMS : Doxorubicin ( DOX ) is an effective anti - cancer therapeutic , but is associated with both acute and late - stage cardiotoxicity .
Children are particularly sensitive to DOX - induced heart failure .
Here , the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs . late - stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Two - week - old MHC - CB7 mice ( which express dominant - interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes ) and their non - transgenic ( NON - TXG ) littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks ( 25 mg / kg cumulative dose ) .
One week after the last DOX treatment ( acute stage ) , MHC - CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON - TXG mice .
Surprisingly , by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment ( late stage ) , MHC - CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON - TXG mice .
p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX - induced STAT3 activation in MHC - CB7 mice , which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 .
Mice with cardiomyocyte - restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function , higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis , and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals .
CONCLUSION : These data support a model wherein a p53 - dependent cardioprotective pathway , mediated via STAT3 activation , mitigates DOX - induced myocardial stress during drug delivery .
Furthermore , these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and , paradoxically , enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment .
