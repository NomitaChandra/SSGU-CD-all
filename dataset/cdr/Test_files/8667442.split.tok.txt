Milk - alkali syndrome induced by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D in a patient with hypoparathyroidism .
Milk - alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali .
Although with current ulcer therapy ( H - 2 blockers , omeprazole , and sucralfate ) , the frequency of milk - alkali syndrome has decreased significantly , the classic triad of hypercalcemia , alkalosis , and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome .
Milk - alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life - threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately .
This article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk - alkali syndrome .
The patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second .
This illustrates intravenous pamidronate as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk - alkali syndrome presents as hypercalcemic emergency .
