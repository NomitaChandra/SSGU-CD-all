Delirium during fluoxetine treatment .
A case report .
The correlation between high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations and central nervous system side effects has been well established .
Only a few reports exist , however , on the relationship between the serum concentrations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and their toxic effects .
In some cases , a high serum concentration of citalopram ( > 600 nmol / L ) in elderly patients has been associated with increased somnolence and movement difficulties .
Widespread cognitive disorders , such as delirium , have not been previously linked with high blood levels of SSRIs .
In this report , we describe a patient with acute hyperkinetic delirium connected with a high serum total fluoxetine ( fluoxetine plus desmethylfluoxetine ) concentration .
