Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-associated acute interstitial nephritis with granular tubular basement membrane deposits.
Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (ATIN) is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from a variety of insults, including immune complex-mediated tubulo-interstitial injury, but drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a far more frequent cause.
Overall, as an entity, ATIN remains under-diagnosed, as symptoms resolve spontaneously if the medication is stopped.
We report on a 14-year-old boy who developed acute renal failure 2 weeks after aortic valve surgery.
He was put on aspirin following surgery and took ibuprofen for fever for nearly a week prior to presentation.
He then presented to the emergency department feeling quite ill and was found to have a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration of of 147 mg/dl, creatinine of 15.3 mg/dl and serum potassium of 8.7 mEq/l.
Dialysis was immediately initiated.
A kidney biopsy showed inflammatory infiltrate consistent with ATIN.
However, in the tubular basement membrane (TBM), very intense granular deposits of polyclonal IgG and C3 were noted.
He needed dialysis for 2 weeks and was treated successfully with steroids for 6 months.
His renal recovery and disappearance of proteinuria took a year.
In conclusion, this is a first report of NSAIDs-associated ATIN, showing deposits of granular immune complex present only in the TBM and not in the glomeruli.
