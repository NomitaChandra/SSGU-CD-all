Tranexamic acid overdosage - induced generalized seizure in renal failure .
We report a 45 - year - old lady with chronic kidney disease stage 4 due to chronic tubulointerstial disease .
She was admitted to our center for severe anemia due to menorrhagia and deterioration of renal function .
She was infused three units of packed cells during a session of hemodialysis .
Tranexamic acid ( TNA ) 1 g 8 - hourly was administered to her to control bleeding per vaginum .
Two hours after the sixth dose of TNA , she had an episode of generalized tonic clonic convulsions .
TNA was discontinued .
Investigations of the patient revealed no biochemical or structural central nervous system abnormalities that could have provoked the convulsions .
She did not require any further dialytic support .
She had no further episodes of convulsion till dis - charge and during the two months of follow - up .
Thus , the precipitating cause of convulsions was believed to be an overdose of TNA .
