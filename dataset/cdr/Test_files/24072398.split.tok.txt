A single neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine induces a long - lasting depressive - like behaviour in mice .
Methamphetamine ( METH ) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and METH abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal .
However , it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of METH also causes a long - lasting depressive phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits .
Thus , we now assessed the depressive - like behaviour in mice at early and long - term periods following a single high METH dose ( 30 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
METH did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task .
However , METH significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post - administration .
This depressive - like profile induced by METH was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission , indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine , DOPAC and HVA , tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin , observed at both 3 and 49 days post - administration .
In parallel , another neurochemical feature of depression - - astroglial dysfunction - - was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker , glial fibrillary acidic protein , were only transiently increased at 3 days .
These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of METH induces long - lasting depressive - like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis .
