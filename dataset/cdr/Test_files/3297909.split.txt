Progressive bile duct injury after thiabendazole administration.
A 27-yr-old man developed jaundice 2 wk after exposure to thiabendazole.
Cholestasis persisted for 3 yr, at which time a liver transplant was performed.
Two liver biopsy specimens and the hepatectomy specimen were remarkable for almost complete disappearance of interlobular bile ducts.
Prominent fibrosis and hepatocellular regeneration were also present; however, the lobular architecture was preserved.
This case represents an example of "idiosyncratic" drug-induced liver damage in which the primary target of injury is the bile duct.
An autoimmune pathogenesis of the bile duct destruction is suggested.
