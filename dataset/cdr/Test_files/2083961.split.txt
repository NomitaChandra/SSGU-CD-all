Acute renal failure due to rifampicin.
A 23-year-old male patient with bacteriologically proven pulmonary tuberculosis was treated with the various regimens of antituberculosis drugs for nearly 15 months.
Rifampicin was administered thrice as one of the 3-4 drug regimen and each time he developed untoward side effects like nausea, vomiting and fever with chills and rigors.
The last such episode was of acute renal failure at which stage the patient was seen by the authors of this report.
The patient, however, made a full recovery.
