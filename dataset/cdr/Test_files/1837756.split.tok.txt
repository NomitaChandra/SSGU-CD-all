Serotonin reuptake inhibitors , paranoia , and the ventral basal ganglia .
Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients .
Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here .
Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms .
Complicated depressive disorders ( including atypicality of course and symptomatology , chronicity , psychosis , bipolarity , and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis ) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors .
Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic , several mechanisms , including 5HT3 receptor - mediated dopamine release , beta - noradrenergic receptor downregulation , or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia ( possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits ) , might apply to this phenomenon .
These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia .
