Acute severe depression following peri - operative ondansetron .
A 41 - year - old woman with a strong history of postoperative nausea and vomiting presented for abdominal hysterectomy 3 months after a previous anaesthetic where ondansetron prophylaxis had been used .
She had developed a severe acute major depression disorder almost immediately thereafter , possibly related to the use of a serotonin antagonist .
Nine years before she had experienced a self - limited puerperal depressive episode .
Anaesthesia with a propofol infusion and avoidance of serotonin antagonists provided a nausea - free postoperative course without exacerbation of the depression disorder .
