A dramatic drop in blood pressure following prehospital GTN administration .
A male in his sixties with no history of cardiac chest pain awoke with chest pain following an afternoon sleep .
The patient did not self medicate .
The patient 's observations were within normal limits , he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) .
Several minutes after the GTN the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate , this was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge .
There was no further deterioration in the patient 's condition during transport to hospital .
There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature .
The cause appears to be the Bezold - Jarish reflex , stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre .
Prehospital care providers who are managing any patient with a syncopal episode that fails to recover within a reasonable time frame should consider the Bezold - Jarisch reflex as the cause and manage the patient accordingly .
