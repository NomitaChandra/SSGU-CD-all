Acute renal failure associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing anthraquinones .
Chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions .
Nephropathy caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported , usually involving the use of aristolochic acids .
We report a 23 - year - old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives , extracted from Rhizoma Rhei ( rhubarb ) .
The renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug , diclofenac .
Renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial fibrosis .
Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills , but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later .
Although a causal relationship between the use of an anthraquinone - containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven , phytotherapy - associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure .
