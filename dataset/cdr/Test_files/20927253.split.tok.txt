Diffuse skeletal pain after administration of alendronate .
BACKGROUND : Osteoporosis is caused by bone resorption in excess of bone formation , and bisphosphonates , are used to inhibit bone resorption .
Alendronate , a biphosphonate , is effective for both the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women .
Side effects are relatively few and prominently gastrointestinal .
Musculoskeletal pain may be an important side effect in these patients .
We presented a patient admitted to our out - patient clinic with diffuse skeletal pain after three consecutive administration of alendronate .
CONCLUSION : We conclude that patients with osteoporosis can report pain , and bisphosphonate - related pain should also be considered before ascribing this complaint to osteoporosis .
