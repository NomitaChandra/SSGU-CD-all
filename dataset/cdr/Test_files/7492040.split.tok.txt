Clinical safety of lidocaine in patients with cocaine - associated myocardial infarction .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the safety of lidocaine in the setting of cocaine - induced myocardial infarction ( MI ) .
DESIGN : A retrospective , multicenter study .
SETTING : Twenty - nine university , university - affiliated , or community hospitals during a 6 - year period ( total of 117 cumulative hospital - years ) .
PARTICIPANTS : Patients with cocaine - associated MI who received lidocaine in the emergency department .
RESULTS : Of 29 patients who received lidocaine in the setting of cocaine - associated MI , no patient died ; exhibited bradydysrhythmias , ventricular tachycardia , or ventricular fibrillation ; or experienced seizures after administration of lidocaine ( 95 % confidence interval , 0 % to 11 % ) .
CONCLUSION : Despite theoretical concerns that lidocaine may enhance cocaine toxicity , the use of lidocaine in patients with cocaine - associated MI was not associated with significant cardiovascular or central nervous system toxicity .
