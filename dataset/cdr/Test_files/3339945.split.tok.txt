Theophylline neurotoxicity in pregnant rats .
The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the neurotoxicity of theophylline is altered in advanced pregnancy .
Sprague - Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of aminophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively .
Theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum ( total ) and CSF were similar but serum ( free ) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats .
Theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats .
Fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former .
It is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the neurotoxic response to theophylline in rats .
