Amiodarone - induced myxoedema coma .
A 62 - year - old man was found to have bradycardia , hypothermia and respiratory failure 3 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation .
Thyroid - stimulating hormone was found to be 168 uIU / mL ( nl .
0 . 3 - 5 uIU / mL ) and free thyroxine ( FT4 ) was < 0 . 2 ng / dL ( nl .
0 . 8 - 1 . 8 ng / dL ) .
He received intravenous fluids , vasopressor therapy and stress dose steroids ; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit .
He received 500 ug of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 h of therapy , and 150 ug intravenous daily thereafter .
Haemodynamic improvement , along with complete recovery of mental status , occurred after 48 h .
Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy , FT4 was 0 . 96 ng / dL .
The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 ( g POorally daily .
A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity .
The 24 hour excretion of iodine was 3657 ( mcg ( 25 - 756 ( mcg ) .
The only two cases of amiodarone - induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement .
This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone - induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease .
