Support for adrenaline - hypertension hypothesis : 18 hour pressor effect after 6 hours adrenaline infusion .
In a double blind , crossover study 6 h infusions of adrenaline ( 15 ng / kg / min ; 1 ng = 5 . 458 pmol ) , noradrenaline ( 30 ng / kg / min ; 1 ng = 5 . 911 pmol ) , and a 5 % dextrose solution ( 5 . 4 ml / h ) , were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks apart .
By means of intra - arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped .
Adrenaline , but not noradrenaline , caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect .
Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 ( SEM 2 ) % and 7 ( 2 ) % , respectively , higher than after dextrose infusion ( ANOVA , p less than 0 . 001 ) .
Thus , " stress " levels of adrenaline ( 230 pg / ml ) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect .
These findings are strong support for the adrenaline - hypertension hypothesis in man .
