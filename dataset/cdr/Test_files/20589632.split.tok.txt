Trimethoprim - induced immune hemolytic anemia in a pediatric oncology patient presenting as an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction .
A 10 - year - old male with acute leukemia presented with post - chemotherapy anemia .
During red cell transfusion , he developed hemoglobinuria .
Transfusion reaction workup was negative .
Drug - induced immune hemolytic anemia was suspected because of positive direct antiglobulin test , negative eluate , and microspherocytes on smear pre - and post - transfusion .
Drug studies using the indirect antiglobulin test were strongly positive with trimethoprim and trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole but negative with sulfamethoxazole .
The patient recovered after discontinuing the drug , with no recurrence in 2 years .
Other causes of anemia should be considered in patients with worse - than - expected anemia after chemotherapy .
Furthermore , hemolysis during transfusion is not always a transfusion reaction .
