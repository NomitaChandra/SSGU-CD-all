Vasovagal syncope and severe bradycardia following intranasal dexmedetomidine for pediatric procedural sedation .
We report syncope and bradycardia in an 11 - year - old girl following administration of intranasal dexmedetomidine for sedation for a voiding cystourethrogram .
Following successful completion of VCUG and a 60 - min recovery period , the patient 's level of consciousness and vital signs returned to presedation levels .
Upon leaving the sedation area , the patient collapsed , with no apparent inciting event .
The patient quickly regained consciousness and no injury occurred .
The primary abnormality found was persistent bradycardia , and she was admitted to the hospital for telemetric observation .
The bradycardia lasted ~2 h , and further cardiac workup revealed no underlying abnormality .
Unanticipated and previously unreported outcomes may be witnessed as we expand the use of certain sedatives to alternative routes of administration .
