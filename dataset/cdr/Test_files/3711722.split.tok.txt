Human and canine ventricular vasoactive intestinal polypeptide : decrease with heart failure .
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is a systemic and coronary vasodilator that may have positive inotropic properties .
Myocardial levels of VIP were assayed before and after the development of heart failure in two canine models .
In the first , cobalt cardiomyopathy was induced in eight dogs ; VIP ( by radioimmunoassay ) decreased from 35 + / - 11 pg / mg protein ( mean + / - SD ) to 5 + / - 4 pg / mg protein ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
In six dogs with doxorubicin - induced heart failure , VIP decreased from 31 + / - 7 to 11 + / - 4 pg / mg protein ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
In addition , VIP content of left ventricular muscle of resected failing hearts in 10 patients receiving a heart transplant was compared with the papillary muscles in 14 patients ( five with rheumatic disease , nine with myxomatous degeneration ) receiving mitral valve prostheses .
The lowest myocardial VIP concentration was found in the hearts of patients with coronary disease ( one patient receiving a transplant and three receiving mitral prostheses ) ( 6 . 3 + / - 1 . 9 pg / mg protein ) .
The other patients undergoing transplantation had an average ejection fraction of 17 % + / - 6 % and a VIP level of 8 . 8 + / - 3 . 9 pg / mg protein .
The hearts without coronary artery disease ( average ejection fraction of this group 62 % + / - 10 % ) had a VIP concentration of 14 . 1 + / - 7 . 9 pg / mg protein , and this was greater than in hearts of the patients with coronary disease and the hearts of patients receiving a transplant ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
Myocardial catecholamines were also determined in 14 subjects ; a weak correlation ( r = 0 . 57 , P less than 0 . 05 ) between the tissue concentrations of VIP and norepinephrine was noted . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) .
