Prednisone induces anxiety and glial cerebral changes in rats .
OBJECTIVE : To assess whether prednisone ( PDN ) produces anxiety and / or cerebral glial changes in rats .
METHODS : Male Wistar rats were studied and 3 groups were formed ( 8 rats per group ) .
The moderate - dose group received 5 mg / kg / day PDN released from a subcutaneous implant .
In the high - dose group , implants containing PDN equivalent to 60 mg / kg / day were applied .
In the control group implants contained no PDN .
Anxiety was assessed using an open field and elevated plus - maze devices .
The number of cells and cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes and microglia cells were assessed by immunohistochemical analyses .
RESULTS : Anxiety was documented in both groups of PDN treated rats compared with controls .
The magnitude of transformation of the microglia assessed by the number of intersections was significantly higher in the PDN groups than in controls in the prefrontal cortex ( moderate - dose , 24 . 1 ; high - dose , 23 . 6 ; controls 18 . 7 ; p < 0 . 01 ) and striatum ( moderate - dose 25 . 6 ; high - dose 26 . 3 ; controls 18 . 9 ; p < 0 . 01 ) , but not in hippocampus .
The number of stained microglia cells was significantly higher in the PDN treated groups in the prefrontal cortex than in controls ( moderate - dose , 29 . 1 ; high - dose , 28 . 4 ; control , 17 . 7 cells per field ; p < 0 . 01 ) .
Stained microglia cells were significantly more numerous striatum and hippocampus in the high - dose group compared to controls .
CONCLUSION : Subacute exposure to PDN induced anxiety and reactivity of microglia .
The relevance of these features for patients using PDN remains to be elucidated .
