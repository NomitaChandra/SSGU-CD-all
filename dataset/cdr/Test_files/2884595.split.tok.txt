Treatment of lethal pertussis vaccine reaction with histamine H1 antagonists .
We studied mortality after pertussis immunization in the mouse .
Without treatment , 73 of 92 animals ( 80 % ) died after injection of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) on day + 7 of pertussis immunization .
After pretreatment with 3 mg of cyproheptadine , 2 mg mianserin , or 2 mg chlorpheniramine , only 5 of 105 animals ( 5 % ) died after receiving BSA on day + 7 ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
Blockade of histamine H1 receptors may reduce mortality in pertussis immunization - induced encephalopathy in mice .
