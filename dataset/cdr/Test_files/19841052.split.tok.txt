Smoking of crack cocaine as a risk factor for HIV infection among people who use injection drugs .
BACKGROUND : Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection .
Given the increasing use of crack cocaine , we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection .
METHODS : We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment , lived in the greater Vancouver area , were HIV - negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow - up study visit .
To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time , we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods : May 1 , 1996 - Nov .
30 , 1999 ( period 1 ) , Dec .
1 , 1999 - Nov .
30 , 2002 ( period 2 ) , and Dec .
1 , 2002 - Dec .
30 , 2005 ( period 3 ) .
RESULTS : Overall , 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study .
Of these , 137 acquired HIV infection during follow - up .
The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11 . 6 % in period 1 to 39 . 7 % in period 3 .
After adjusting for potential confounders , we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time ( period 1 : hazard ratio [ HR ] 1 . 03 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0 . 57 - 1 . 85 ; period 2 : HR 1 . 68 , 95 % CI 1 . 01 - 2 . 80 ; and period 3 : HR 2 . 74 , 95 % CI 1 . 06 - 7 . 11 ) .
INTERPRETATION : Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users .
This finding points to the urgent need for evidence - based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine .
