Blockade of endothelial - mesenchymal transition by a Smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .
OBJECTIVE : A multicenter , controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin - angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy , suggesting that other mechanism ( s ) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy ( diabetic nephropathy ) .
We have previously demonstrated that endothelial - mesenchymal - transition ( EndoMT ) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin ( STZ ) - induced diabetes .
In the present study , we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line ( MMEC ) in the presence of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) and in the endothelial lineage - traceble mouse line Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP by administration of AGEs , with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control .
Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation / Western blotting and confocal microscopy .
Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 ( SIS3 ) were performed in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP mice .
RESULTS : Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP mice .
Immunoprecipitation / Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy .
Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT , reduced renal fibrosis , and retarded progression of nephropathy .
CONCLUSIONS : EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy .
Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications .
