Physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine - induced seizures in the rat .
Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial .
In order to elucidate this problem , we have studied the effect of long - term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures .
Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool .
Thereafter , seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non - trained control groups .
During the acute period of status epilepticus , we measured : ( 1 ) the latency of the first motor sign , ( 2 ) the intensity of seizures , ( 3 ) the time when it occurred within the 6 - h observation period , and ( 4 ) the time when the acute period ended .
All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus .
