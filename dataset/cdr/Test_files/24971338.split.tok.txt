Conversion to sirolimus ameliorates cyclosporine - induced nephropathy in the rat : focus on serum , urine , gene , and protein renal expression biomarkers .
Protocols of conversion from cyclosporin A ( CsA ) to sirolimus ( SRL ) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent CsA - induced nephropathy , but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear .
This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of CsA - to - SRL conversion in a rat model .
Four animal groups ( n = 6 ) were tested during 9 weeks : control , CsA , SRL , and conversion ( CsA for 3 weeks followed by SRL for 6 weeks ) .
Classical and emergent serum , urinary , and kidney tissue ( gene and protein expression ) markers were assessed .
Renal lesions were analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin , periodic acid - Schiff , and Masson 's trichrome stains .
SRL - treated rats presented proteinuria and NGAL ( serum and urinary ) as the best markers of renal impairment .
Short CsA treatment presented slight or even absent kidney lesions and TGF - b , NF - kb , mTOR , PCNA , TP53 , KIM - 1 , and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes .
Prolonged CsA exposure aggravated renal damage , without clear changes on the traditional markers , but with changes in serums TGF - b and IL - 7 , TBARs clearance , and kidney TGF - b and mTOR .
Conversion to SRL prevented CsA - induced renal damage evolution ( absent / mild grade lesions ) , while NGAL ( serum versus urine ) seems to be a feasible biomarker of CsA replacement to SRL .
