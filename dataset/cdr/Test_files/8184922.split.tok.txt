Assessment of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mice .
The ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize DNA in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice .
Isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult C3Heb / FeJ mice resulted in a 46 % increase in heart weight and a 19 . 3 % increase in cardiomyocyte area .
No DNA synthesis , as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes , was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts .
A survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13 % mononucleate , suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background .
To determine whether the capacity for reactive DNA synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation , cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey .
These data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize DNA in response to isoproterenol - induced cardiac hypertrophy .
