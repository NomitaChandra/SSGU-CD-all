Prevalence of heart disease in asymptomatic chronic cocaine users.
To determine the prevalence of heart disease in outpatient young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users, 35 cocaine users and 32 age-matched controls underwent resting and exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and Doppler echocardiography.
Findings consistent with coronary artery disease were detected in 12 (34%) patients and 3 (9%) controls (p = 0.01).
Decreased left ventricular systolic function was demonstrated in 5 (14%) patients, but in none of the controls (p = 0.055).
Finally, resting and peak exercise abnormal left ventricular filling was detected in 38 and 35% of patients as compared to 19 and 9% of controls, respectively (p = 0.11 and 0.02, respectively).
We conclude that coronary artery or myocardial disease is common (38%) in young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users.
Therefore, screening ECG and echocardiography may be warranted in these patients.
