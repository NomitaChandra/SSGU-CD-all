Pituitary response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone during haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia.
The effects of a 6-hour infusion with haloperidol on serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was studied in a group of male subjects.
Five hours after starting the infusions, a study of the pituitary responses to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) was carried out.
Control patients received infusions of 0.9% NaCl solution.
During the course of haloperidol infusions, significant hyperprolactinemia was found, together with an abolished pituitary response to LH-RH, as compared with responses of control subjects.
