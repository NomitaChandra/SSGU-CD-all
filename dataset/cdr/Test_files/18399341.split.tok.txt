Clinical comparison of cardiorespiratory effects during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia .
BACKGROUND : Spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post - spinal block hypotension .
Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia .
METHODS : With ethical approval , we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) , physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery .
Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups : lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups .
In the lateral position with operative side down , patients recived 10 mg ( 2mls ) of 0 . 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25 - gauge spinal needle .
Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection .
Blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour .
RESULTS : Three patients ( 8 . 1 % ) in the unilateral group and 5 ( 13 . 5 % ) in the conventional group developed hypotension , P = 0 . 71 .
Four ( 10 . 8 % ) patients in the conventional group and 1 ( 2 . 7 % ) in the unilateral group , P = 0 . 17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension .
Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15 , 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline ( P = 0 . 003 , 0 . 001 and 0 . 004 ) .
The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar .
CONCLUSION : Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia , unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations .
Also , the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation .
