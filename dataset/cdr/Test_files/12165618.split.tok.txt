Persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .
BACKGROUND : Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults .
These well - documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children .
DESIGN : A prospective study to monitor indinavir - related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .
METHODS : Urinary pH , albumin , creatinine , the presence of erythrocytes , leukocytes , bacteria and crystals , and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks .
Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points .
Steady - state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir .
RESULTS : The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia ( > or = 75 cells / micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits ) after 96 weeks was 53 % .
Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin / creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria .
The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels > 50 % above normal was 33 % after 96 weeks .
Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50 % above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia .
In children younger than 5 . 6 years , persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children .
A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve > 19 mg / L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir > 12 mg / L .
In 4 children , indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity .
Subsequently , the serum creatinine levels decreased , the urine albumin / creatinine ratios returned to zero , and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months .
CONCLUSIONS : Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia .
Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of > 50 % above normal .
Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications .
The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis .
Indinavir - associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely , especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia , age < 5 . 6 years , an area under the curve of indinavir > 19 mg / L x h , and a C ( max ) > 12 mg / L .
