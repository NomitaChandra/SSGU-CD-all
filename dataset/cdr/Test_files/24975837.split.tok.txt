Kinin B2 receptor deletion and blockage ameliorates cisplatin - induced acute renal injury .
Cisplatin treatment has been adopted in some chemotherapies ; however , this drug can induce acute kidney injury due its ability to negatively affect renal function , augment serum levels of creatinine and urea , increase the acute tubular necrosis score and up - regulate cytokines ( e . g . , IL - 1b and TNF - a ) .
The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the inflammation process , as well as the regulation of cytokine expression , and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the diabetic nephropathy status .
To examine the role of the kinin B2 receptor in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury , kinin B2 receptor knockout mice were challenged with cisplatin .
Additionally , WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after cisplatin administration .
B2 receptor - deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice , as shown by reduced weight loss , better preservation of kidney function , down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less acute tubular necrosis .
Moreover , treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration .
Thus , our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines , thus resulting in declined renal function .
These results highlight the kinin B2 receptor antagonist treatment in amelioration of nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin therapy .
