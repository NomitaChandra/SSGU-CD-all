Lamivudine is effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus DNA in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen carriers : a placebo - controlled trial .
Lamivudine is a novel 2 ' , 3 ' - dideoxy cytosine analogue that has potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in vivo .
We performed a single - blind , placebo - controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) carriers .
Forty - two Chinese HBsAg carriers were randomized to receive placebo ( 6 patients ) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg , 100 mg , or 300 mg daily ( 12 patients for each dosage ) .
The drug was given for 4 weeks .
The patients were closely monitored clinically , biochemically , and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment .
All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA values of > 90 % ( P < . 001 compared with placebo ) .
Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg ( P = . 011 ) and 300 mg ( P = . 005 ) , it still induced 94 % suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy .
HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy .
There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels .
No serious adverse events were observed .
In conclusion , a 4 - week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers .
The suppression was > 90 % but reversible .
Studies with long - term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved .
