Acute neurologic dysfunction after high - dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma .
Etoposide ( VP - 16 - 213 ) has been used in the treatment of many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies .
When used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation , this agent has activity against several treatment - resistant cancers including malignant glioma .
In six of eight patients ( 75 % ) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma , sudden severe neurologic deterioration occurred .
This developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high - dose etoposide therapy .
Significant clinical manifestations have included confusion , papilledema , somnolence , exacerbation of motor deficits , and sharp increase in seizure activity .
These abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high - dose intravenous dexamethasone therapy .
In all patients , computerized tomographic ( CT ) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and peritumor edema when compared with pretransplant scans .
This complication appears to represent a significant new toxicity of high - dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma .
