The flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats .
The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin ( 20 mg / kg intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) , 1 h before acquisition ) , on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step - through passive avoidance task , in young male Wistar rats .
There were no differences between saline - and apigenin - treated groups in the 24 h retention trial .
Furthermore , apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 1mg / kg , i . p . , 30 min before the acquisition ) .
The saline - and apigenin - treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut - off time ( 540 s ) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks .
In the saline treated group , the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks , and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task .
At the end of the experimental period , 60 % of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through .
These data suggest that 1 ) apigenin delays the long - term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2 ) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system .
