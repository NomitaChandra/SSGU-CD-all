The role of p - aminophenol in acetaminophen - induced nephrotoxicity : effect of bis ( p - nitrophenyl ) phosphate on acetaminophen and p - aminophenol nephrotoxicity and metabolism in Fischer 344 rats .
Acetaminophen ( APAP ) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 ( F344 ) rats .
Recently , p - aminophenol ( PAP ) , a known potent nephrotoxicant , was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats .
The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP - induced nephrotoxicity .
Therefore , the effect of bis ( p - nitrophenyl ) phosphate ( BNPP ) , an acylamidase inhibitor , on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined .
BNPP ( 1 to 8 mM ) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration - dependent manner .
Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP ( 900 mg / kg ) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity .
This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue .
Rather , BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75 % after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg / kg .
BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non - deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg / kg .
Therefore , the BNPP - induced reduction in APAP - induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation .
It is concluded that PAP formation , in vivo , accounts , at least in part , for APAP - induced renal tubular necrosis .
