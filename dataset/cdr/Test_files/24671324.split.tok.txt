Necrotising fasciitis after bortezomib and dexamethasone - containing regimen in an elderly patient of Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia .
Bortezomib and high - dose dexamethasone - containing regimens are considered to be generally tolerable with few severe bacterial infections in patients with B - cell malignancies .
However , information is limited concerning the safety of the regimen in elderly patients .
We report a case of a 76 - year - old man with Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia who suffered necrotising fasciitis without neutropenia after the combination treatment with bortezomib , high - dose dexamethasone and rituximab .
Despite immediate intravenous antimicrobial therapy , he succumbed 23 h after the onset .
Physicians should recognise the possibility of fatal bacterial infections related to bortezomib plus high - dose dexamethasone in elderly patients , and we believe this case warrants further investigation .
