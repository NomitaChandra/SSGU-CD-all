Hydroxytyrosol ameliorates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in rats with breast cancer .
Oxidative stress is involved in several processes including cancer , aging and cardiovascular disease , and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as doxorubicin .
Doxorubicin causes significant cardiotoxicity characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction .
Herein , we investigate whether doxorubicin - associated chronic cardiac toxicity can be ameliorated with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol in rats with breast cancer .
Thirty - six rats bearing breast tumors induced chemically were divided into 4 groups : control , hydroxytyrosol ( 0 . 5mg / kg , 5days / week ) , doxorubicin ( 1mg / kg / week ) , and doxorubicin plus hydroxytyrosol .
Cardiac disturbances at the cellular and mitochondrial level , mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I - IV and apoptosis - inducing factor , and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed .
Hydroxytyrosol improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage .
These results suggest that hydroxytyrosol improve the mitochondrial electron transport chain .
This study demonstrates that hydroxytyrosol protect rat heart damage provoked by doxorubicin decreasing oxidative damage and mitochondrial alterations .
