Prolonged hypothermia as a bridge to recovery for cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension associated with fulminant hepatic failure .
BACKGROUND : To review evidence - based treatment options in patients with cerebral edema complicating fulminant hepatic failure ( FHF ) and discuss the potential applications of hypothermia .
METHOD : Case - based observations from a medical intensive care unit ( MICU ) in a tertiary care facility in a 27 - year - old female with FHF from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema .
RESULTS : Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2 - day period .
The patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission .
Initial evaluation confirmed FHF from acetaminophen and cerebral edema .
The patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy , hyperventilation , sedation , and chemical paralysis .
Her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy .
We then initiated therapeutic hypothermia which was continued for 5 days .
At re - warming , patient had resolution of her cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension .
At discharge , she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions .
CONCLUSION : In patients with FHF and cerebral edema from acetaminophen overdose , prolonged therapeutic hypothermia could potentially be used as a life saving therapy and a bridge to hepatic and neurological recovery .
A clinical trial of hypothermia in patients with this condition is warranted .
