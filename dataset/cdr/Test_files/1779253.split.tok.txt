Topical 0 . 025 % capsaicin in chronic post - herpetic neuralgia : efficacy , predictors of response and long - term course .
In order to evaluate the efficacy , time - course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin , 39 patients with chronic post - herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) , median duration 24 months , were treated with 0 . 025 % capsaicin cream for 8 weeks .
During therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and a verbal outcome scale .
A follow - up investigation was performed 10 - 12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved .
Nineteen patients ( 48 . 7 % ) substantially improved after the 8 - week trial ; 5 ( 12 . 8 % ) discontinued therapy due to side - effects such as intolerable capsaicin - induced burning sensations ( 4 ) or mastitis ( 1 ) ; 15 ( 38 . 5 % ) reported no benefit .
The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application .
Of the responders 72 . 2 % were still improved at the follow - up ; only one - third of them had continued application irregularly .
Treatment effect was not dependent on patient 's age , duration or localization of PHN ( trigeminal involvement was excluded ) , sensory disturbance or pain character .
Treatment response was not correlated with the incidence , time - course or severity of capsaicin - induced burning .
If confirmed in controlled trials , the long - term results of this open , non - randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in PHN is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes ( perhaps degeneration ) of nociceptive afferents .
