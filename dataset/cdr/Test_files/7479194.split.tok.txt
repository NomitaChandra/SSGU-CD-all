A large population - based follow - up study of trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole , trimethoprim , and cephalexin for uncommon serious drug toxicity .
We conducted a population - based 45 - day follow - up study of 232 , 390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( TMP - SMZ ) , 266 , 951 prescribed trimethoprim alone , and 196 , 397 prescribed cephalexin , to estimate the risk of serious liver , blood , skin , and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs .
The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom , together with a review of clinical records .
The risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed TMP - SMZ ( 5 . 2 / 100 , 000 ) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone ( 3 . 8 / 100 , 000 ) .
The risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower ( 2 . 0 / 100 , 000 ) .
Only five patients experienced blood disorders , one of whom was exposed to TMP - SMZ ; of seven with erythema multiforme and Stevens - Johnson syndrome , four were exposed to TMP - SMZ .
The one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin .
Finally , only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred , none likely to be caused by a study drug .
We conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents , and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics .
