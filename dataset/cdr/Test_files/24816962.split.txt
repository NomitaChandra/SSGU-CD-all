Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy: an uncommon scenario.
Metronidazole can produce neurological complications although it is not a common scenario.
We present a case where a patient developed features of encephalopathy following prolonged metronidazole intake.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed abnormal signal intensity involving both dentate nuclei of cerebellum and splenium of corpus callosum.
The diagnosis of metronidazole toxicity was made by the MRI findings and supported clinically.
