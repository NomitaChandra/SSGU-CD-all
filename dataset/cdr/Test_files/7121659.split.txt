Antirifampicin antibodies in acute rifampicin-associated renal failure.
5 patients with acute renal failure (3 with thrombopenia and hemolysis) induced by the reintroduction of rifampicin are described.
No correlation was found between the severity of clinical manifestations and the total dose taken by the patients.
In all but 1 patient, antirifampicin antibodies were detected.
Antibodies suggested to be of the IgM class were detected in all 3 patients with hematological disorders.
The pattern of non-specific acute tubular necrosis found in the 2 biopsied patients, indistinguishable from that of ischemic origin, raised the possibility of a vascular-mediated damage.
In 3 patients, the possibility of a triggering immunoallergic mechanism is discussed.
