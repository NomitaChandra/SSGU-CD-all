Rifampicin - associated segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis in staphylococcal endocarditis .
Segmental necrotising glomerulonephritis has been reported as complication of rifampicin therapy in patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis .
Changing epidemiology of infections such as infective endocarditis ( IE ) has led to an increase in the use of rifampicin for Staphylococcal infections .
We describe a case of a patient with Staphylococcal IE who developed acute renal failure secondary to a segmental necrotising glomerulonephritis while being treated with rifampicin , and review the literature regarding this complication of rifampicin therapy .
