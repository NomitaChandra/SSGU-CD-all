Mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with aminonucleoside nephrosis .
The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) model .
Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections ; five controls received saline only .
After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric ( 190 + / - 80 mg / 24 hr ) , and all rats were given colloidal carbon ( CC ) intravenously .
At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7 . 6 + / - 3 . 4 % of the glomeruli of PAN rats ; glomeruli of the controls were normal .
Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls .
Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non - sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys .
CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli .
Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment , we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently .
Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model .
Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to " mesangial overloading . " .
