Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5 - fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection .
From 1986 to 1998 , 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) were identified .
None of the patients had decompensated liver disease .
Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0 . 5 to 5 days ( mean : 2 . 6 + / - 1 . 3 days ) after the initiation of chemotherapy .
Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg % ( mean : 626 + / - 431 microg % ) .
Among the 32 episodes , 26 ( 81 % ) had various degrees of azotemia , 18 ( 56 % ) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 ( 44 % ) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration .
Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections ( p = 0 . 003 and 0 . 0006 , respectively ) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses ( 2600 or 1800 mg / m2 ) of 5 - FU ( p = 0 . 0001 and < 0 . 0001 , respectively ) .
In 25 out of 32 episodes ( 78 % ) , plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management .
In conclusion , hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5 - FU .
Azotemia , body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients .
It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5 - FU .
