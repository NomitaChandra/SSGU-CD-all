Vinorelbine - related cardiac events : a meta - analysis of randomized clinical trials .
Several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vinorelbine ( VNR ) have been reported in the literature .
In order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events , we performed a meta - analysis of clinical trials comparing VNR with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malignancies .
Randomized clinical trials comparing VNR with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in Medline , Embase , Evidence - based Medicine Reviews databases and the Cochrane library from 1987 to 2002 .
Outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events , toxic deaths and cardiac event - related deaths reported in each publication .
We found 19 trials , involving 2441 patients treated by VNR and 2050 control patients .
The incidence of cardiac events with VNR was 1 . 19 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0 . 75 ; 1 . 67 ) ] .
There was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between VNR and other drugs [ odds ratio : 0 . 92 , 95 % CI ( 0 . 54 ; 1 . 55 ) ] .
The risk of VNR cardiac events was similar to vindesine ( VDS ) and other cardiotoxic drugs [ fluorouracil , anthracyclines , gemcitabine ( GEM ) em leader ] .
Even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases , the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history , and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre - existing cardiac diseases .
Vinorelbine - related cardiac events concern about 1 % of treated patients in clinical trials .
However , the risk associated with VNR seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications .
