Thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer .
We prospectively evaluated thalidomide - induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies .
Sixty - seven men with metastatic androgen - independent prostate cancer in an open - label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies ( NCS ) prior to and at 3 - month intervals during treatment .
NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials ( SNAPs ) from median , radial , ulnar , and sural nerves .
SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline , and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index .
A 40 % decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant .
Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response .
Of 67 patients initially enrolled , 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months , 8 remained at 6 months , and 3 remained at 9 months .
Six patients developed neuropathy .
Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently .
Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors .
Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients .
The SNAP index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy , but not for early detection .
