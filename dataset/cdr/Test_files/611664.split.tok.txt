Use of propranolol in the treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension .
Five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study .
They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine .
Treatment with propanolol administered intravenously ( 1 - 5 mg ) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11 / 6 to 22 / 11 mmHg .
Chronic oral administration of propranolol ( 40 - 160 mg / day ) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20 - 35 / 15 - 25 mmg being observed .
In 1 patient , marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn .
It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed .
Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6 - 13 months with persistence of the pressor effect , although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time .
Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therapy .
The studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension .
