Flurothyl seizure thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) : evaluation of experimental parameters in flurothyl seizure testing .
Monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits .
These studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of MSG produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility , since previous investigations were inconclusive .
A flurothyl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of MSG ( 4 mg / g and 1 mg / g ) .
MSG treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure threshold .
A naloxone ( 5 mg / kg ) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of MSG - treated mice .
Flurothyl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flurothyl exposure ; however , the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was unclear .
Flurothyl seizure testing proved to be a rapid and reliable technique with which to evaluate seizure susceptibility .
