Effect of D - Glucarates on basic antibiotic - induced renal damage in rats .
Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only .
Oral administration of 2 , 5 - di - O - acetyl - D - glucaro - 1 , 4 - 6 , 3 - dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin - dextran .
The protective effect was prevalent among D - glucarates , and also to other saccharic acid , hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids , although to a lesser degree , but not to a hexaaldose , sugar alcohols , substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds .
D - Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis .
Dose - responses were observed in the protective effect of D - Glucarates .
With a D - glucarate of a fixed size of dose , approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics .
D - Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it .
Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides .
The reduction effect of D - glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed .
