Studies of risk factors for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity .
The epidemiology of aminoglycoside - induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood .
Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients , but rarely , if ever , cause glomerular or tubular dysfunction .
Clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70 % to 80 % .
Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy , plasma aminoglycoside levels , liver disease , advanced age , high initial estimated creatinine clearance and , possibly , female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity .
Other causes of acute renal failure , such as shock , appear to have an additive effect .
Predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high risk .
These models may also be useful in developing insights into the pathophysiology of aminoglycoside - induced nephrotoxicity .
