Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .
OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .
The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .
Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .
METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .
Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .
b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .
Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .
RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .
As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .
In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .
