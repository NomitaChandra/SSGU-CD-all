Comparison of laryngeal mask with endotracheal tube for anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions, including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure, during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway (FRLMA) versus endotracheal tube (ETT) in maintaining controlled hypotension anesthesia induced by propofol-remifentanil total i.v.
anesthesia (TIVA).
METHODS: Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled hypotension anesthesia caused by propofol-remifentanil-TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups: group I, FRLMA; group II, ETT.
Hemorrhage was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six-point scale.
RESULTS: Controlled hypotension was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of remifentanil infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled hypotension anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of remifentanil during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS.
