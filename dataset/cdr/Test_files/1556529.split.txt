Zidovudine-induced hepatitis.
A case of acute hepatitis induced by zidovudine in a 38-year-old patient with AIDS is presented.
The mechanism whereby the hepatitis was induced is not known.
However, the patient tolerated well an alternative reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 2'3' dideoxyinosine.
Physicians caring for patients with AIDS should be aware of this hitherto rarely reported complication.
