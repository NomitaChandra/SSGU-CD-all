Ascending dose tolerance study of intramuscular carbetocin administered after normal vaginal birth .
OBJECTIVE : To determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of carbetocin ( a long - acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin ) , when administered immediately after vaginal delivery at term .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Carbetocin was given as an intramuscular injection immediately after the birth of the infant in 45 healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally at term .
Dosage groups of 15 , 30 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 125 , 150 , 175 or 200 microg carbetocin were assigned to blocks of three women according to the continual reassessment method ( CRM ) .
RESULTS : All dosage groups consisted of three women , except those with 100 microg ( n = 6 ) and 200 microg ( n = 18 ) .
Recorded were dose - limiting adverse events : hyper - or hypotension ( three ) , severe abdominal pain ( 0 ) , vomiting ( 0 ) and retained placenta ( four ) .
Serious adverse events occurred in seven women : six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml , four cases of manual placenta removal , five cases of additional oxytocics administration and five cases of blood transfusion .
Maximum blood loss was greatest at the upper and lower dose levels , and lowest in the 70 - 125 microg dose range .
Four out of six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml occurred in the 200 microg group .
The majority of additional administration of oxytocics ( 4 / 5 ) and blood transfusion ( 3 / 5 ) occurred in the dose groups of 200 microg .
All retained placentae were found in the group of 200 microg .
CONCLUSION : The MTD was calculated to be at 200 microg carbetocin .
