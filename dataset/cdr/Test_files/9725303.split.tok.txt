Nonopaque crystal deposition causing ureteric obstruction in patients with HIV undergoing indinavir therapy .
OBJECTIVE : We describe the unique CT features of ureteric calculi in six HIV - infected patients receiving indinavir , the most commonly used HIV protease inhibitor , which is associated with an increased incidence of urolithiasis .
CONCLUSION : Ureteric obstruction caused by precipitated indinavir crystals may be difficult to diagnose with unenhanced CT .
The calculi are not opaque , and secondary signs of obstruction may be absent or minimal and should be sought carefully .
Images may need to be obtained using i . v .
contrast material to enable diagnosis of ureteric stones or obstruction in patients with HIV infection who receive indinavir therapy .
