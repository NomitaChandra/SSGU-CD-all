Propranolol antagonism of phenylpropanolamine - induced hypertension .
Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) overdose can cause severe hypertension , intracerebral hemorrhage , and death .
We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA - induced hypertension .
Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA .
PPA , 75 mg alone , increased blood pressure ( 31 + / - 14 mm Hg systolic , 20 + / - 5 mm Hg diastolic ) , and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase ( 12 + / - 10 mm Hg systolic , 10 + / - 7 mm Hg diastolic ) .
Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure .
Left ventricular function ( assessed by echocardiography ) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30 % ( from 62 . 5 + / - 20 . 9 to 80 . 8 + / - 22 . 4 ml ) , the ejection fraction 9 % ( from 64 % + / - 10 % to 70 % + / - 7 % ) , and cardiac output 14 % ( from 3 . 6 + / - 0 . 6 to 4 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 L / min ) .
Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects .
Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28 % ( from 1710 + / - 200 to 2190 + / - 700 dyne X sec / cm5 ) and was further increased by propranolol 22 % ( to 2660 + / - 1200 dyne X sec / cm5 ) .
We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output , and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output .
That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine .
This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine .
