Case - control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory use and end - stage renal disease .
BACKGROUND : Studies on the association between the long - term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) have given conflicting results .
In order to examine this association , a case - control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out .
METHODS : The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1 , 1995 and November 30 , 1997 .
They were classified according to the underlying disease , which had presumably led them to ESRD .
Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose , also matched by age and sex .
Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model , including potential confounding factors , both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases .
RESULTS : Five hundred and eighty - three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis .
Long - term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1 . 22 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 89 - 1 . 66 ) .
For specific groups of drugs , the risks were 1 . 56 ( 1 . 05 - 2 . 30 ) for aspirin , 1 . 03 ( 0 . 60 - 1 . 76 ) for pyrazolones , 0 . 80 ( 0 . 39 - 1 . 63 ) for paracetamol , and 0 . 94 ( 0 . 57 - 1 . 56 ) for nonaspirin NSAIDs .
The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use , and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [ 2 . 35 ( 1 . 17 - 4 . 72 ) ] .
CONCLUSION : Our data indicate that long - term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD .
However , the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD .
