Safety and efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) in birdshot retinochoroidopathy .
PURPOSE : To report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy .
METHODS : A retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients ( 11 eyes ) .
Eleven patients ( 11 eyes ) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) .
Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline , before fluocinolone acetonide implant , and then at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years .
Disease activity markers , including signs of ocular inflammation , evidence of retinal vasculitis , Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis , electroretinographic parameters , and optical coherence tomography were recorded .
Data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes .
RESULTS : Intraocular inflammation was present in 54 . 5 , 9 . 9 , 11 . 1 , and 0 % of patients at baseline , 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant , respectively .
Active vasculitis was noted in 36 . 3 % patients at baseline and 0 % at 3 years of follow - up .
More than 20 % ( 47 . 61 - 67 . 2 % ) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant .
At baseline , 54 . 5 % patients were on immunomodulatory agents .
This percentage decreased to 45 . 45 , 44 . 4 , and 14 . 28 % at 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant , respectively .
Adverse events included increased intraocular pressure ( 54 . 5 % ) and cataract formation ( 100 % ) .
CONCLUSION : The data suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) helps to control inflammation in otherwise treatment - refractory cases of birdshot retinochoroidopathy .
It is associated with significant side effects of cataract and ocular hypertension requiring treatment .
