A case of postoperative anxiety due to low dose droperidol used with patient - controlled analgesia .
A multiparous woman in good psychological health underwent urgent caesarean section in labour .
Postoperatively , she was given a patient - controlled analgesia device delivering boluses of diamorphine 0 . 5 mg and droperidol 0 . 025 mg .
Whilst using the device she gradually became anxious , the feeling worsening after each bolus .
The diagnosis of droperidol - induced psychological disturbance was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear history .
After she had received a total of only 0 . 9 mg droperidol , a syringe containing diamorphine only was substituted and her unease resolved completely .
We feel that , although the dramatic extrapyramidal side effects of dopaminergic antiemetics are well known , more subtle manifestations may easily be overlooked .
