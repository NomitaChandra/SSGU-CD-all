Hormones and risk of breast cancer .
This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy .
The majority ( 29 ) had surgical menopause ; their mean age was 45 . 7 years .
It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy .
The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens ( Premarin ) 1 . 25 mg / day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg / day for 10 days in each month .
The mean treatment period was 18 months .
During the follow - up period , attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology , physical examination , and plate thermography .
Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients , and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women .
Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia .
Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose .
These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied : 1 ) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical , metabolic , cytologic , and mammographic perspective ; 2 ) cyclic treatment schedule , with a progestative phase of 10 days ; and 3 ) periodic complete follow - up , with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues .
