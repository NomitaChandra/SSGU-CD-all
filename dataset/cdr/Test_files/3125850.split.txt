Increase in intragastric pressure during suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations in children: inhibition by alfentanil.
Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v.
were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1.
Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1.
The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group.
The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O).
The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78).
It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children.
Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.
