Optochiasmatic and peripheral neuropathy due to ethambutol overtreatment.
Ethambutol is known to cause optic neuropathy and, more rarely, axonal polyneuropathy.
We characterize the clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging findings in a 72-year-old man who developed visual loss and paresthesias after 11 weeks of exposure to a supratherapeutic dose of ethambutol.
This case demonstrates the selective vulnerability of the anterior visual pathways and peripheral nerves to ethambutol toxicity.
