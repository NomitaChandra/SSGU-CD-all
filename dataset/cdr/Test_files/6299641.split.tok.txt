Evidence for cardiac beta 2 - adrenoceptors in man .
We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol ( cardioselective ) , 40 mg propranolol ( nonselective ) , and placebo on both exercise - and isoproterenol - induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects .
Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 + / - 4 ( SEM ) after placebo to 146 + / - 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 + / - 6 bpm after propranolol , but there were no differences between the drugs .
The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine ( 0 . 04 mg / kg IV ) .
Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm ( CD25 ) and this was increased from 1 . 8 + / - 0 . 3 micrograms after placebo to 38 . 9 + / - 8 . 3 micrograms after propranolol and 8 . 3 + / - 1 . 7 micrograms after atenolol .
The difference in the effects of the two was significant .
After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo ( 2 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 micrograms ) and atenolol ( 7 . 7 + / - 1 . 3 micrograms ) ; it was reduced after propranolol ( 24 . 8 + / - 5 . 0 micrograms ) , but remained different from atenolol .
This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka , this was unchanged by atropine ( 11 . 7 + / - 2 . 1 and 10 . 1 + / - 2 . 5 ml / ng ) .
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise - induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1 - receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs , whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1 - and beta 2 - receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2 - component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug .
While there appear to be beta 2 - receptors in the human heart , their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined .
