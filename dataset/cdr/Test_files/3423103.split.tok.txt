Participation of a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in clonidine - induced hypotension and bradycardia .
The effects of microinjection of clonidine ( 1 - 10 micrograms in 1 microliter ) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane - anesthetized rats .
Intramedullary administration of clonidine , but not saline vehicle , caused a dose - dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate .
The clonidine - induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection , but not bilateral vagotomy .
On the other hand , the clonidine - induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy , but not spinal transection .
Furthermore , selective destruction of the spinal 5 - HT nerves , produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine , reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats .
The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine - induced hypotension and bradycardia .
The induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity , whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity .
