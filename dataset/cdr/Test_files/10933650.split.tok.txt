Attenuation of nephrotoxicity by a novel lipid nanosphere ( NS - 718 ) incorporating amphotericin B .
NS - 718 , a lipid nanosphere incorporating amphotericin B , is effective against pathogenic fungi and has low toxicity .
We compared the toxicity of NS - 718 with that of Fungizone ( amphotericin B - sodium deoxycholate ; D - AmB ) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis , histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of amphotericin B following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats .
Incubation with NS - 718 resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with D - AmB .
Serum blood urea and creatinine concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of D - AmB 3 mg / kg but not in those given the same dose of NS - 718 .
Histopathological examination of the kidney showed tubular necrosis in D - AmB - treated rats but no change in NS - 718 - treated rats .
Amphotericin B concentrations in the kidney in NS - 718 - treated rats were higher than those in D - AmB - treated rats .
Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that incorporation of amphotericin B into lipid nanospheres of NS - 718 attenuates the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B .
