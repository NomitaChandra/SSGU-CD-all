Glial activation and post - synaptic neurotoxicity : the key events in Streptozotocin ( ICV ) induced memory impairment in rats .
In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin ( STZ ) induced memory impaired rats was explored .
In experiment set up 1 : Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14 - 16 days after STZ ( ICV ; 3mg / Kg ) administration .
STZ causes increased expression of GFAP , CD11b and TNF - a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation .
STZ also significantly increased the level of ROS , nitrite , Ca ( 2 + ) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity .
Increased expression and activity of Caspase - 3 was also observed in STZ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex .
STZ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD - 95 , while , expression of pre synaptic markers ( synaptophysin and SNAP - 25 ) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity .
Oral treatment with Memantine ( 10mg / kg ) and Ibuprofen ( 50 mg / kg ) daily for 13 days attenuated STZ induced glial activation , apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain .
Further , in experiment set up 2 : where memory function was not affected i . e .
7 - 9 days after STZ treatment .
The level of GFAP , CD11b , TNF - a , ROS and nitrite levels were increased .
On the other hand , apoptotic marker , synaptic markers , mitochondrial activity and Ca ( 2 + ) levels remained unaffected .
Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function .
Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in STZ induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death .
