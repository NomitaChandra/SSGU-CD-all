Indomethacin - induced morphologic changes in the rat urinary bladder epithelium .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the morphologic changes in rat urothelium induced by indomethacin .
Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug - induced cystitis is a poorly recognized and under - reported condition .
In addition to tiaprofenic acid , indomethacin has been reported to be associated with this condition .
METHODS : Three groups were established : a control group ( n = 10 ) , a high - dose group ( n = 10 ) , treated with one intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin 20 mg / kg , and a therapeutic dose group ( n = 10 ) in which oral indomethacin was administered 3 . 25 mg / kg body weight daily for 3 weeks .
The animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studies .
RESULTS : The light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high - dose group .
When compared with the control group , both indomethacin groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa ( P < 0 . 0001 ) and penetration of lanthanum nitrate through intercellular areas of the epithelium .
Furthermore , the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant ( P < 0 . 0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Indomethacin resulted in histopathologic findings typical of interstitial cystitis , such as leaky bladder epithelium and mucosal mastocytosis .
The true incidence of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug - induced cystitis in humans must be clarified by prospective clinical trials .
