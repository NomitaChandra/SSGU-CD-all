Ischemic colitis and sumatriptan use .
Sumatriptan succinate , a serotonin - 1 ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine - 1 ) receptor agonist , is an antimigraine drug that is reported to act by selectively constricting intracranial arteries .
Recently , vasopressor responses that are distinct from the cranial circulation have been demonstrated to occur in the systemic , pulmonary , and coronary circulations .
Cases have been published of coronary vasospasm , myocardial ischemia , and myocardial infarction occurring after sumatriptan use .
