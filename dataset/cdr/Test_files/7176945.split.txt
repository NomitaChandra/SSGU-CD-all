Post-suxamethonium pains in Nigerian surgical patients.
Contrary to an earlier report by Coxon, scoline pain occurs in African negroes.
Its incidence was determined in a prospective study involving a total of 100 Nigerian patients (50 out-patients and 50 in-patients).
About 62% of the out-patients developed scoline pain as compared with about 26% among the in-patients.
The abolition of muscle fasciculations (by 0.075mg/kg dose of Fazadinium) did not influence the occurrence of scoline pain.
Neither the type of induction agent (Althesin or Thiopentone) nor the salt preparation of suxamethonium used (chloride or bromide), affected the incidence of scoline pain.
