Increased frequency and severity of angio - oedema related to long - term therapy with angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor in two patients .
Adverse reactions to drugs are well recognized as a cause of acute or chronic urticaria , and angio - oedema .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure , were introduced in Europe in the middle of the eighties , and the use of these drugs has increased progressively .
Soon after the introduction of ACE inhibitors , acute bouts of angio - oedema were reported in association with the use of these drugs .
We wish to draw attention to the possibility of adverse reactions to ACE inhibitors after long - term use and in patients with pre - existing angio - oedema .
