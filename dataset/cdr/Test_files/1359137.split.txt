Neuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia.
Can it be treated with bromocriptine?
Six stable psychiatric outpatients with hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea associated with their neuroleptic medications were treated with bromocriptine.
Daily dosages of 5-10 mg corrected the hyperprolactinemia and restored menstruation in four of the six patients.
One woman, however, developed worsened psychiatric symptoms while taking bromocriptine, and it was discontinued.
Thus, three of six patients had their menstrual irregularity successfully corrected with bromocriptine.
This suggests that bromocriptine should be further evaluated as potential therapy for neuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea/galactorrhea.
