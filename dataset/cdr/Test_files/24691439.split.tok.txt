Ocular - specific ER stress reduction rescues glaucoma in murine glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma .
Administration of glucocorticoids induces ocular hypertension in some patients .
If untreated , these patients can develop a secondary glaucoma that resembles primary open - angle glaucoma ( POAG ) .
The underlying pathology of glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma is not fully understood , due in part to lack of an appropriate animal model .
Here , we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma that exhibits glaucoma features that are observed in patients .
Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0 . 1 % dexamethasone led to elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , functional and structural loss of retinal ganglion cells , and axonal degeneration , resembling glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma in human patients .
Furthermore , dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork ( TM ) .
Similar to patients , withdrawal of dexamethasone treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model .
Dexamethasone induced the transcriptional factor CHOP , a marker for chronic ER stress , in the anterior segment tissues , and Chop deletion reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension .
Furthermore , reduction of ER stress in the TM with sodium 4 - phenylbutyrate prevented dexamethasone - induced ocular hypertension in WT mice .
Our data indicate that ER stress contributes to glucocorticoid - induced ocular hypertension and suggest that reducing ER stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid - induced glaucoma .
