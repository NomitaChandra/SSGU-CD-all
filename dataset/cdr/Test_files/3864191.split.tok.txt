Salicylate nephropathy in the Gunn rat : potential role of prostaglandins .
We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat .
The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase , leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla .
These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration .
We used homozygous ( jj ) and phenotypically normal heterozygous ( jJ ) animals .
Four groups of rats ( n = 7 ) were studied : jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg / kg every other day or sham - treated .
After one week , slices of cortex , outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay .
The other kidney was examined histologically .
A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups .
PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla , but not cortex or inner medulla , of jj ( 38 + / - 6 ng / mg prot ) than jJ rats ( 15 + / - 3 ) ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .
Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions , but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj ( 18 + / - 3 ) than jJ rats ( 9 + / - 2 ) ( p less than 0 . 05 ) .
PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration ( p less than 0 . 05 ) .
The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin - treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by : increased incidence and severity of hematuria ( p less than 0 . 01 ) ; increased serum creatinine ( p less than 0 . 05 ) ; and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions ( p less than 0 . 005 compared to either sham - treated jj or aspirin - treated jJ ) .
These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity , and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function .
