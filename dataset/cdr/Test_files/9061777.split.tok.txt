MK - 801 augments pilocarpine - induced electrographic seizure but protects against brain damage in rats .
1 . The authors examined the anticonvulsant effects of MK - 801 on the pilocarpine - induced seizure model .
Intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine ( 400 mg / kg ) induced tonic and clonic seizure .
Scopolamine ( 10 mg / kg ) and pentobarbital ( 5 mg / kg ) prevented development of pilocarpine - induced behavioral seizure but MK - 801 ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) did not .
2 .
An electrical seizure measured with hippocampal EEG appeared in the pilocarpine - treated group .
Scopolamine and pentobarbital blocked the pilocarpine - induced electrographic seizure , MK - 801 treatment augmented the electrographic seizure induced by pilocarpine .
3 .
Brain damage was assessed by examining the hippocampus microscopically .
Pilocarpine produced neuronal death in the hippocampus , which showed pyknotic changes .
Pentobarbital , scopolamine and MK - 801 protected the brain damage by pilocarpine , though in the MK - 801 - treated group , the pyramidal cells of hippocampus appeared darker than normal .
In all treatments , granule cells of the dentate gyrus were not affected .
4 .
These results indicate that status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine is initiated by cholinergic overstimulation and propagated by glutamatergic transmission , the elevation of which may cause brain damage through an excitatory NMDA receptor - mediated mechanism .
