Syncope caused by hyperkalemia during use of a combined therapy with the angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor and spironolactone .
A 76 year - old woman with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and prior myocardial infarction was transferred to the emergency room with loss of consciousness due to marked bradycardia caused by hyperkalemia .
The concentration of serum potassium was high , and normal sinus rhythm was restored after correction of the serum potassium level .
The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be several doses of spiranolactone , an aldosterone antagonist , in addition to the long - term intake of ramipril , an ACE inhibitor .
This case is a good example of electrolyte imbalance causing acute life - threatening cardiac events .
Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of hyperkalemia , especially in elderly patients using ACE / ARB in combination with potassium sparing agents and who have mild renal disturbance .
