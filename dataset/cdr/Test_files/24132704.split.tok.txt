Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through ERK1 / 2 pathway in rat liver .
INTRODUCTION : Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture .
It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism .
Moreover , the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established .
Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathways in low - density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLr ) expression .
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism , ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon .
Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied .
METHODS : 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks ; Corn oil ( control ) , diazinon ( 15mg / kg per day , orally ) and crocin ( 12 . 5 and 25mg / kg per day , intraperitoneally ) in combination with diazinon ( 15 mg / kg ) .
The levels of cholesterol , triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed .
Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1 / 2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1 / 2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis .
RESULTS : Our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol , triglyceride and LDL .
Moreover diazinon decreased ERK1 / 2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript .
Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and diazinon - induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of LDLr transcript .
CONCLUSIONS : Crocin may be considered as a novel protective agent in diazinon - induced hyperlipemia through modulating of ERK pathway and increase of LDLr expression .
