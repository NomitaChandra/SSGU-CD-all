Fatty liver induced by tetracycline in the rat .
Dose - response relationships and effect of sex .
Dose - response relationships , biochemical mechanisms , and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro .
In the intact male and female rat , no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride .
With provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver , a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats .
Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line ( control ) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride .
Accumulation of hepatic triglyceride , as a per cent of control values , in response to graded doses of tetracycline , did not differ significantly between male , female and pregnant rat livers .
However , livers from female , and especially pregnant female rats , were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions .
These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid .
Depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50 % of accumulated hepatic triglyceride , indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride - rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline .
