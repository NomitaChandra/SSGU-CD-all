A Case of Sudden Cardiac Death due to Pilsicainide - Induced Torsades de Pointes .
An 84 - year - old male received oral pilsicainide , a pure sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics , to convert his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to a sinus rhythm ; the patient developed sudden cardiac death two days later .
The Holter electrocardiogram , which was worn by chance , revealed torsade de pointes with gradually prolonged QT intervals .
This drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract , and most of it is excreted from the kidney .
Although the patient 's renal function was not highly impaired and the dose of pilsicainide was low , the plasma concentration of pilsicainide may have been high , which can produce torsades de pointes in the octogenarian .
Although the oral administration of class IC drugs , including pilsicainide , is effective to terminate atrial fibrillation , careful consideration must be taken before giving these drugs to octogenarians .
