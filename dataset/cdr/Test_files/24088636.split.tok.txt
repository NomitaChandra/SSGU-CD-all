Linezolid - induced optic neuropathy .
Many systemic antimicrobials have been implicated to cause ocular adverse effects .
This is especially relevant in multidrug therapy where more than one drug can cause a similar ocular adverse effect .
We describe a case of progressive loss of vision associated with linezolid therapy .
A 45 - year - old male patient who was on treatment with multiple second - line anti - tuberculous drugs including linezolid and ethambutol for extensively drug - resistant tuberculosis ( XDR - TB ) presented to us with painless progressive loss of vision in both eyes .
Color vision was defective and fundus examination revealed optic disc edema in both eyes .
Ethambutol - induced toxic optic neuropathy was suspected and tablet ethambutol was withdrawn .
Deterioration of vision occurred despite withdrawal of ethambutol .
Discontinuation of linezolid resulted in marked improvement of vision .
Our report emphasizes the need for monitoring of visual function in patients on long - term linezolid treatment .
