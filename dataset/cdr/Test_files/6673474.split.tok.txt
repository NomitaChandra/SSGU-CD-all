Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism under deliberate hypotension .
An experimental study in dogs .
Coronary blood flow , cardiac work and metabolism were studied in dogs under sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) and trimetaphan ( TMP ) deliberate hypotension ( 20 % and 40 % mean pressure decrease from baseline ) .
Regarding the effects of drug - induced hypotension on coronary blood flow , aortic and coronary sinus metabolic data ( pH , pO2 , pCO2 ) we could confirm that nitroprusside hypotension could be safely used to 30 % mean blood pressure decrease from control , trimetaphan hypotension to 20 % mean blood pressure decrease .
Cardiac work was significantly reduced during SNP hypotension .
Myocardial O2 consumption and O2 availability were directly dependent on the coronary perfusion .
Careful invasive monitoring of the blood pressure , blood gases and of the ECG ST - T segment is mandatory .
