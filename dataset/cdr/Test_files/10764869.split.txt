A case of bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient on tacrolimus (FK506) therapy after liver transplantation.
PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient receiving tacrolimus (FK 506, Prograf; Fujisawa USA, Inc, Deerfield, Illinois) for immunosuppression after orthotropic liver transplantation.
METHOD: Case report.
In a 58-year-old man receiving tacrolimus after orthotropic liver transplantation, serial neuro-ophthalmologic examinations and laboratory studies were performed.
RESULTS: The patient had episodic deterioration of vision in both eyes, with clinical features resembling ischemic optic neuropathies.
Deterioration of vision occurred despite discontinuation of the tacrolimus.
CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus and other immunosuppressive agents may be associated with optic nerve toxicity.
