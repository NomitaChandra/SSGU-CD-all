Mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency : focus on venous function .
Loss of endothelial cell - derived nitric oxide ( NO ) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction .
Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO , however , involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity .
These include augmented endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1 ) release , increased sympathetic nervous system activity , and elevated tissue oxidative stress .
We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle ( venomotor ) tone plays a role in Nomega - nitro - L - arginine ( LNNA ) hypertension through these mechanisms .
Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA ( 0 . 5 g / L in drinking water ) for 2 weeks .
Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 + / - 2 mm Hg in control and 194 + / - 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction .
Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET - 1 was significantly reduced ( 54 % control ) .
Maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine ( 37 % control ) also was reduced but no change in response to ET - 1 was observed .
Mean circulatory filling pressure , an in vivo measure of venomotor tone , was not elevated in LNNA hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA .
The superoxide scavenger tempol ( 30 , 100 , and 300 micromol kg ( - 1 ) , IV ) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose - dependent decrease in LNNA rats ( - 18 + / - 8 , - 26 + / - 15 , and - 54 + / - 11 mm Hg ) .
Similarly , ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats ( 76 + / - 9 mm Hg ) compared with control rats ( 35 + / - 10 mm Hg ) .
Carotid arteries , vena cava , and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats .
These data suggest that while NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels , the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension .
