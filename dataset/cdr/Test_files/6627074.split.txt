Succinylcholine apnoea: attempted reversal with anticholinesterases.
Anticholinesterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged neuromuscular blockade following the administration of succinylcholine in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase.
Edrophonium 10 mg, given 74 min after succinylcholine, when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase II block, produced partial antagonism which was not sustained.
Repeated doses of edrophonium to 70 mg and neostigmine to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block.
Spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after succinylcholine administration.
It is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in succinylcholine apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase II block.
