A double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study .
Procaterol , a new beta - 2 adrenoceptor stimulant , was studied in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over trial in patients with bronchial asthma .
Oral procaterol 50 micrograms b . d . , procaterol 100 micrograms b . d . , and terbutaline 5 mg t . i . d . , were compared when given randomly in 1 - week treatment periods .
