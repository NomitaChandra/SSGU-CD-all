Penicillamine - related lichenoid dermatitis and utility of zinc acetate in a Wilson disease patient with hepatic presentation , anxiety and SPECT abnormalities .
Wilson 's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism with consequent copper accumulation and toxicity in many tissues and consequent hepatic , neurologic and psychiatric disorders .
We report a case of Wilson 's disease with chronic liver disease ; moreover , in our patient , presenting also with high levels of state anxiety without depression , 99mTc - ECD - SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes , more marked on the left frontal lobe .
During the follow - up of our patient , penicillamine was interrupted after the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis , and zinc acetate permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side - effects .
In our case the therapy with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a Wilson 's disease patient in which penicillamine - related side effects appeared .
The safety of the zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs ; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Wilson 's disease .
Since most of Wilson 's disease penicillamine - treated patients do not seem to develop this skin lesion , it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in drug response .
Further studies are needed for a better clarification of Wilson 's disease therapy , and in particular to differentiate specific therapies for different Wilson 's disease phenotypes .
