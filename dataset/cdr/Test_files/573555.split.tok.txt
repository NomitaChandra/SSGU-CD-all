Long - term propranolol therapy in pregnancy : maternal and fetal outcome .
Propranolol , a beta - adrenergic blocking agent , has found an important position in the practice of medicine .
Its use in pregnancy , however , is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neonate .
Ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic propranolol has been administered .
Five patients with serial pregnancies with and without propranolol therapy are also examined .
Maternal , fetal , and neonatal complications are examined .
An attempt is made to differentiate drug - related complications from maternal disease - - related complications .
We conclude that previously reported hypoglycemia , hyperbilirubinemia , polycythemia , neonatal apnea , and bradycardia are not invariable and can not be statistically correlated with chronic propranolol therapy .
Growth retardation , however , appears to be significant in both of our series .
