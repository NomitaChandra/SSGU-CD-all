Human corticotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone modulate the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans.
Human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) are known to stimulate ventilation after i.v.
administration in humans.
In a placebo-controlled, single-blind study we aimed to clarify if both peptides act by altering central chemosensitivity.
Two subsequent CO2-rebreathing tests were performed in healthy young volunteers.
During the first test 0.9% NaCl was given i.v.; during the second test 200 micrograms of hCRH (n = 12) or 400 micrograms of TRH (n = 6) was administered i.v.
Nine subjects received 0.9% NaCl i.v.
during both rebreathing manoeuvres.
The CO2-response curves for the two tests were compared within the same subject.
In the hCRH group a marked parallel shift of the CO2-response curve to the left was observed after hCRH (P < 0.01).
The same effect occurred following TRH but was less striking (P = 0.05).
hCRH and TRH caused a reduction in the CO2 threshold.
The CO2-response curves in the control group were nearly identical.
The results indicate an additive effect of both releasing hormones on the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans, presumably independent of central chemosensitivity.
