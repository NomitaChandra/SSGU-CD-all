The biological properties of the optical isomers of propranolol and their effects on cardiac arrhythmias .
1 . The optical isomers of propranolol have been compared for their beta - blocking and antiarrhythmic activities . 2 .
In blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline , ( + ) - propranolol had less than one hundredth the potency of ( - ) - propranolol .
At dose levels of ( + ) - propranolol which attenuated the responses to isoprenaline , there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram . 3 .
The metabolic responses to isoprenaline in dogs ( an increase in circulating glucose , lactate and free fatty acids ) were all blocked by ( - ) - propranolol .
( + ) - Propranolol had no effect on fatty acid mobilization but significantly reduced the increments in both lactate and glucose . 4 .
Both isomers of propranolol possessed similar depressant potency on isolated atrial muscle taken from guinea - pigs . 5 .
The isomers of propranolol exhibited similar local anaesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of procaine .
The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer . 6 .
Both isomers of propranolol were capable of preventing adrenaline - induced cardiac arrhythmias in cats anaesthetized with halothane , but the mean dose of ( - ) - propranolol was 0 . 09 + / - 0 . 02 mg / kg whereas that of ( + ) - propranolol was 4 . 2 + / - 1 . 2 mg / kg .
At the effective dose level of ( + ) - propranolol there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram .
Blockade of arrhythmias with both isomers was surmountable by increasing the dose of adrenaline . 7 .
Both isomers of propranolol were also capable of reversing ventricular tachycardia caused by ouabain in anaesthetized cats and dogs .
The dose of ( - ) - propranolol was significantly smaller than that of ( + ) - propranolol in both species but much higher than that required to produce evidence of beta - blockade . 8 .
The implications of these results are discussed .
