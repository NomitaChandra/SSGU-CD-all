Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early - Life Arsenic Exposure : Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps .
BACKGROUND : Millions of individuals worldwide , particularly those living in rural and developing areas , are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) in their drinking water .
Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood .
There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early - life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases , particularly in relationship to cancer .
OBJECTIVES : This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early - life iAs exposure .
DISCUSSION : Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression , the development of cancer stem cells , and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early - life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects .
CONCLUSIONS : Evidence is mounting that relates early - life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life .
Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early - life exposure , molecular alterations , and latent disease outcomes .
