Morphine - induced seizures in newborn infants .
Two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post - operative analgesia .
They received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms / kg / hr and 40 micrograms / kg / hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6 - 24 micrograms / kg / hr and had no seizures .
Plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive ( 60 and 90 mg / ml ) .
Other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months .
It is suggested that post - operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms / kg / ml in neonates .
