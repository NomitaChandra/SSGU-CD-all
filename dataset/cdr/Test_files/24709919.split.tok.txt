Effects of ginsenosides on opioid - induced hyperalgesia in mice .
Opioid - induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by the cessation of chronic opioid use .
OIH can limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from opioid addiction .
In this study , we investigated the effects of Re , Rg1 , and Rb1 ginsenosides , the bioactive components of ginseng , on OIH .
OIH was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of morphine for 7 consecutive days three times per day .
During withdrawal ( days 8 and 9 ) , these mice were administered Re , Rg1 , or Rb1 intragastrically two times per day .
On the test day ( day 10 ) , mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid - induced writhing test .
Re ( 300 mg / kg ) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid - induced writhing test .
However , the Rg1 and Rb1 ginsenosides failed to prevent OIH in either test .
Furthermore , Rg1 showed a tendency to aggravate OIH in the acetic acid - induced writhing test .
Our data suggested that the ginsenoside Re , but not Rg1 or Rb1 , may contribute toward reversal of OIH .
