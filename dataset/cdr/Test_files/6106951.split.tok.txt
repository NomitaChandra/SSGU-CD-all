Central excitatory actions of flurazepam .
Toxic actions of flurazepam ( FZP ) were studied in cats , mice and rats .
High doses caused an apparent central excitation , most clearly seen as clonic convulsions , superimposed on general depression .
Following a lethal dose , death was always associated with convulsions .
Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness , while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions .
Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation , extreme apprehensive behavior , retching , muscle tremors and convulsions .
An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol ( PTZ ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge .
As a function of dose , FZP first protected against convulsions and death .
At higher doses , however , convulsions again emerged .
These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions .
These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability , such as epilepsy or sedative - hypnotic drug withdrawal .
