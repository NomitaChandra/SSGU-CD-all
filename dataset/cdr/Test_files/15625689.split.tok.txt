Swallowing abnormalities and dyskinesia in Parkinson 's disease .
Gastrointestinal abnormalities in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) have been known for almost two centuries , but many aspects concerning their pathophysiology have not been completely clarified .
The aim of this study was to characterize the oropharyngeal dynamics in PD patients with and without levodopa - induced dyskinesia .
Fifteen dyskinetic , 12 nondyskinetic patients , and a control group were included .
Patients were asked about dysphagia and evaluated with the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale Parts II and III and the Hoehn and Yahr scale .
Deglutition was assessed using modified barium swallow with videofluoroscopy .
Nondyskinetic patients , but not the dyskinetic ones , showed less oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency ( OPSE ) for liquid food than controls ( Dunnett , P = 0 . 02 ) .
Dyskinetic patients tended to have a greater OPSE than nondyskinetic ( Dunnett , P = 0 . 06 ) .
Patients who were using a higher dose of levodopa had a greater OPSE and a trend toward a smaller oral transit time ( Pearson 's correlation , P = 0 . 01 and 0 . 08 , respectively ) .
Neither the report of dysphagia nor any of the PD severity parameters correlated to the videofluoroscopic variables .
In the current study , dyskinetic patients performed better in swallowing function , which could be explained on the basis of a greater levodopa dose .
Our results suggest a role for levodopa in the oral phase of deglutition and confirm that dysphagia is not a good predictor of deglutition alterations in PD .
