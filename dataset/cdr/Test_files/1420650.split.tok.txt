Asterixis induced by carbamazepine therapy .
There are very few reports about asterixis as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmacologic agents .
In this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs , in whom asterixis was triggered either by adding carbamazepine ( CBZ ) to a treatment regimen , or by increasing its dosage .
Neither dosage nor serum levels of CBZ were in a higher range .
We consider asterixis to be an easily overlooked sign of neurotoxicity , which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels , if certain drugs as lithium or clozapine are used in combination with CBZ .
