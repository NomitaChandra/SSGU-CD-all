Genetic separation of tumor growth and hemorrhagic phenotypes in an estrogen - induced tumor .
Chronic administration of estrogen to the Fischer 344 ( F344 ) rat induces growth of large , hemorrhagic pituitary tumors .
Ten weeks of diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) treatment caused female F344 rat pituitaries to grow to an average of 109 . 2 + / - 6 . 3 mg ( mean + / - SE ) versus 11 . 3 + / - 1 . 4 mg for untreated rats , and to become highly hemorrhagic .
The same DES treatment produced no significant growth ( 8 . 9 + / - 0 . 5 mg for treated females versus 8 . 7 + / - 1 . 1 for untreated females ) or morphological changes in Brown Norway ( BN ) rat pituitaries .
An F1 hybrid of F344 and BN exhibited significant pituitary growth after 10 weeks of DES treatment with an average mass of 26 . 3 + / - 0 . 7 mg compared with 8 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 mg for untreated rats .
Surprisingly , the F1 hybrid tumors were not hemorrhagic and had hemoglobin content and outward appearance identical to that of BN .
Expression of both growth and morphological changes is due to multiple genes .
However , while DES - induced pituitary growth exhibited quantitative , additive inheritance , the hemorrhagic phenotype exhibited recessive , epistatic inheritance .
Only 5 of the 160 F2 pituitaries exhibited the hemorrhagic phenotype ; 36 of the 160 F2 pituitaries were in the F344 range of mass , but 31 of these were not hemorrhagic , indicating that the hemorrhagic phenotype is not merely a consequence of extensive growth .
The hemorrhagic F2 pituitaries were all among the most massive , indicating that some of the genes regulate both phenotypes .
