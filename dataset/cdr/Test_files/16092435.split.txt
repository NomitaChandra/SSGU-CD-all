Morphological evaluation of the effect of d-ribose on adriamycin-evoked cardiotoxicity in rats.
The influence of d-ribose on adriamycin-induced myocardiopathy in rats was studied.
Adriamycin in the cumulative dose of 25 mg/kg evoked fully developed cardiac toxicity.
D-ribose in the multiple doses of 200 mg/kg did not influence ADR cardiotoxicity.
