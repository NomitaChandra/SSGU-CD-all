Fatal carbamazepine induced fulminant eosinophilic ( hypersensitivity ) myocarditis : emphasis on anatomical and histological characteristics , mechanisms and genetics of drug hypersensitivity and differential diagnosis .
The most severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine have been observed in the haemopoietic system , the liver and the cardiovascular system .
A frequently fatal , although exceptionally rare side effect of carbamazepine is necrotizing eosinophilic ( hypersensitivity ) myocarditis .
We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine .
Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically , and the diagnosis was made post - mortem .
Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage .
Clinically , death was due to cardiogenic shock .
To best of our knowledge this is the second case of fatal carbamazepine induced myocarditis reported in English literature .
