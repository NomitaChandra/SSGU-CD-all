Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high - dose daptomycin in suspected Staphylococcus aureus meningitis .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of methicillin - sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high - dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concentrations .
CASE SUMMARY : A 54 - year - old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health - care - associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph .
Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and piperacillin / tazobactam .
Blood cultures revealed S . aureus susceptible to oxacillin .
Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4 .
On day 8 , the patient developed acute renal failure ( serum creatinine 1 . 9 mg / dL , increased from 1 . 2 mg / dL the previous day and 0 . 8 mg / dL on admission ) .
The patient 's Glasgow Coma Score was 3 , with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10 .
The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9 , increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system ( CNS ) infection .
Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg / kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient 's death on day 16 .
Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11 . 21 ug / mL and 0 . 52 ug / mL , respectively , prior to the third dose .
Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA .
Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed .
DISCUSSION : Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin - induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia .
At a dose of 9 mg / kg , resultant penetration of 5 % was higher than in previous reports , more consistent with inflamed meninges .
CONCLUSIONS : High - dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or can not tolerate standard therapy .
Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted .
