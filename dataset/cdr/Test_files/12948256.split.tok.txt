Ethambutol and optic neuropathy .
PURPOSE : To demonstrate the association between ethambutol and optic neuropathy .
METHOD : Thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with ethambutol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed .
The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome .
RESULTS : All patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months ( mean = 2 . 9 months ) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg / kg / day ( mean = 17 mg / kg / day ) .
Seven ( 54 % ) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug .
Of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment , 4 patients had diabetes mellitus , glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking .
CONCLUSION : Early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with ethambutol therapy .
A low dose and prompt discontinuation of the drug is recommended particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus , glaucoma or who are heavy smokers .
