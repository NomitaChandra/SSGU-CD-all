Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol.
BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic.
One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose-limiting nephrotoxicity.
There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity, including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin with and without mannitol.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage.
Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012.
The primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI).
RESULTS: We evaluated 143 patients who received single-agent cisplatin; 97.2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy.
Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.646 (95% CI = 1.008, 6.944; P = 0.048).
Patients who received the 100 mg/m(2) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity: OR = 11.494 (95% CI = 4.149, 32.258; P < 0.0001) and OR = 3.219 (95% CI = 1.228, 8.439; P = 0.017), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When limited quantities of mannitol are available, it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity.
Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol.
