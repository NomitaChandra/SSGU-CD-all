Intracavernous epinephrine: a minimally invasive treatment for priapism in the emergency department.
Priapism is the prolonged erection of the penis in the absence of sexual arousal.
A 45-year-old man, an admitted frequent cocaine user, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) on two separate occasions with a history of priapism after cocaine use.
The management options in the ED, as exemplified by four individual case reports, in particular the use of a minimally invasive method of intracorporal epinephrine instillation, are discussed.
