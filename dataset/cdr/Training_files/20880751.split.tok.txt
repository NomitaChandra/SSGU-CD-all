Levodopa - induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson 's disease : filling the bench - to - bedside gap .
Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson 's disease .
However , the long - term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias .
Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa - induced dyskinesias , their pathogenesis is still unclear .
In recent years , evidence from animal models of Parkinson 's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post - receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements .
Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms , dopamine receptor subtypes , ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors , and non - dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
