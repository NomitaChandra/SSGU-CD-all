Treatment of tinnitus by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine ( lidocaine ) 2 per cent through ventilation tubes .
Idiopathic subjective tinnitus ( IST ) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies .
This paper presents the results of treating IST by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine ( lidocaine ) 2 per cent through a grommet , for five weekly courses .
Fifty - two patients suffering from intractable tinnitus entered this therapeutic trial , but only nine finished all five courses .
In one patient , the tinnitus was almost completely abolished , but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one .
We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs , acupuncture and biofeedback , with disappointing results .
Patients should be warned about the side effects of vertigo and vomiting , which subsides gradually with every new instillation , and that the tinnitus may not disappear but will be alleviated , enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life .
