Angiosarcoma of the liver associated with diethylstilbestrol.
Angiosarcoma of the liver occurred in a 76-year-old man who had been treated for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver with diethylstilbestrol for 13 years.
Angiosarcoma was also present within pulmonary and renal arteries.
The possibility that the intraarterial lesions might represent independent primary tumors is considered.
