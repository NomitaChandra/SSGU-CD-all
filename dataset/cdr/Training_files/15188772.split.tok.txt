Severe reversible left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to accidental iatrogenic epinephrine overdose .
Catecholamine - induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon .
In contrast , reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are rare .
A 35 - year - old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stunning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise , profound , albeit transient , left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction , and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis .
Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision .
