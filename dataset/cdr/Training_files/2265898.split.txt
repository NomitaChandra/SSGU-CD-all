Serial epilepsy caused by levodopa/carbidopa administration in two patients on hemodialysis.
Two patients with similar clinical features are presented: both patients had chronic renal failure, on hemodialysis for many years but recently begun on a high-flux dialyzer; both had been receiving a carbidopa/levodopa preparation; and both had the onset of hallucinosis and recurrent seizures, which were refractory to anticonvulsants.
The first patient died without a diagnosis; the second patient had a dramatic recovery following the administration of vitamin B6.
Neither patient was considered to have a renal state sufficiently severe enough to explain their presentation.
