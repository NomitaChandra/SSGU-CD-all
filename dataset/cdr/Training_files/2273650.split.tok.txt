Facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine and its state dependency in the step - through type passive avoidance learning test in mice .
Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial ( pre - test ) , and pre - test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial .
Similarly , pre - test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine - induced amnesia , but not significantly ; and pre - test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide - induced amnesia .
These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test morphine might be the direct action of morphine rather than a state dependent effect .
