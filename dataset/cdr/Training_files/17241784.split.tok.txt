Progressive myopathy with up - regulation of MHC - I associated with statin therapy .
Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug .
What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy , which persists or may progress after stopping the drug .
We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases .
All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate .
In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up - regulation of MHC - I expression even in non - necrotic fibres .
Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate , and in one case spontaneously .
These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune - mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy .
The mechanism of this myopathy is uncertain but may involve the induction by statins of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up - regulation of MHC - I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres .
