Palpebral twitching in a depressed adolescent on citalopram .
Current estimates suggest that between 0 . 4 % and 8 . 3 % of children and adolescents are affected by major depression .
We report a favorable response to treatment with citalopram by a 15 - year - old boy with major depression who exhibited palpebral twitching during his first 2 weeks of treatment .
This may have been a side effect of citalopram as it remitted with redistribution of doses .
