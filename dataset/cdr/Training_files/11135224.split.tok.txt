Paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma .
BACKGROUND : Cisplatin - based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) .
The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease .
METHODS : The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility , response rate , and toxicity of a paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC .
Thirty - five consecutive chemotherapy - naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 - 2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel ( 135 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 3 hours ) on Day 1 , cisplatin ( 120 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 6 hours ) on Day 1 , and gemcitabine ( 800 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 30 minutes ) on Days 1 and 8 , every 4 weeks .
Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second - line chemotherapy after disease progression , the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given .
RESULTS : All the patients were examined for toxicity ; 34 were examinable for response .
An objective response was observed in 73 . 5 % of the patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 55 . 6 - 87 . 1 % ) , including 4 complete responses ( 11 . 7 % ) .
According to intention - to - treat , the overall response rate was 71 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 53 .
7 - 85 . 4 % ) .
After 154 courses of therapy , the median dose intensity was 131 mg / m ( 2 ) for paclitaxel ( 97 . 3 % ) , 117 mg / m ( 2 ) for cisplatin ( 97 . 3 % ) , and 1378 mg / m ( 2 ) for gemcitabine ( 86 . 2 % ) .
World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39 . 9 % and 11 . 4 % of patients , respectively .
There was one treatment - related death .
Nonhematologic toxicities were mild .
After a median follow - up of 22 months , the median progression free survival rate was 7 months , and the median survival time was 16 months .
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC .
This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin - based regimens .
