Antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier PG - 9 .
The antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl ) propionate [ ( + / - ) - PG - 9 ] ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 s . c . ; 30 - 60 mg kg - 1 p . o . ; 10 - 30 mg kg - 1 i . v . ; 10 - 30 micrograms / mouse i . c . v . ) was examined in mice , rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot - plate , abdominal - constriction , tail - flick and paw - pressure tests .
( + / - ) - PG - 9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished .
The antinociception produced by ( + / - ) - PG - 9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine , the M1 - selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium - 3 , but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone , the gamma - aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3 - aminopropyl - diethoxy - methyl - phosphinic acid , the H3 agonist R - ( alpha ) - methylhistamine , the D2 antagonist quinpirole , the 5 - hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2 - methoxy - 4 - amino - 5 - chlorobenzoic acid 2 - ( diethylamino ) ethyl ester hydrochloride , the 5 - hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1 - ( 2 - methoxyphenyl ) - 4 - [ 4 - ( 2 - phthalimido ) butyl ] piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine .
Based on these data , it can be postulated that ( + / - ) - PG - 9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission .
( + / - ) - PG - 9 ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) and dicyclomine ( 2 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) in the mouse passive - avoidance test .
Affinity profiles of ( + / - ) - PG - 9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes , determined by functional studies ( rabbit vas deferens for M1 , guinea pig atrium for M2 , guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4 ) , have shown an M4 / M1 selectivity ratio of 10 . 2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti - amnesic effect induced by ( + / - ) - PG - 9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels .
In the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range , ( + / - ) - PG - 9 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota - rod test and Animex apparatus .
