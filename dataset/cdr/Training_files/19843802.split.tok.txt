When drugs disappear from the patient : elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration .
Twenty - three hours after heart transplantation , life - threatening acute right heart failure was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) .
Increasing doses of catecholamines , sedatives , and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective .
However , a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis .
Thus , interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected .
The catheters were changed , and hemodynamics stabilized at lower catecholamine doses .
When the effects of IV drugs are inadequate in patients receiving CVVHDF , interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by CVVHDF should be suspected .
