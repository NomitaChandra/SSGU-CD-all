Adverse effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on nephrosclerosis in rats with renovascular hypertension .
The effect of a 6 - week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure , albuminuria , renal hemodynamics , and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two - kidney , one clip renovascular hypertension .
Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery , hypertensive rats ( 178 + / - 4 mm Hg ) were randomly assigned to three groups : untreated hypertensive controls ( n = 8 ) , enalapril - treated ( n = 8 ) , or nitrendipine - treated ( n = 10 ) .
Sham - operated rats served as normotensive controls ( 128 + / - 3 mm Hg , n = 8 ) .
After 6 weeks of treatment , renal hemodynamics ( glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow ) were measured in the anesthetized rats .
Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis .
Enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly .
After 6 weeks of therapy , glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups .
Renal plasma flow increased , but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment .
In contrast , in the nitrendipine - treated group albuminuria increased from 12 . 8 + / - 2 progressively to 163 + / - 55 compared with 19 . 2 + / - 9 mg / 24 hr in the hypertensive controls .
Furthermore , glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine - treated group compared with the hypertensive controls ( 0 . 38 + / - 0 . 1 versus 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 04 ) .
In addition , glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine - treated group ( 14 . 9 + / - 0 . 17 10 ( - 3 ) mm2 ) but lower in the enalapril - treated group ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 15 10 ( - 3 ) mm2 ) compared with the hypertensive controls ( 12 . 1 + / - 0 . 17 10 ( - 3 ) mm2 ) .
