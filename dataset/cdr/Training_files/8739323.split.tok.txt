Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on renal toxicity .
The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen ( NG ) , methotrexate ( MTX ) , 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and cyclophosphamide ( CY ) administered alone or in combination [ MTX + 5 - FU + CY ( CMF ) ] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats .
After drug administration , creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined , as well as creatinine clearance .
Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed .
After MTX administration a significant increase ( p = 0 . 0228 ) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant ( p = 0 . 0001 ) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls .
After the administration of NG , 5 - FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics .
Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen , a statistically significant decrease ( p = 0 . 0343 ) in creatinine clearance was found , but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls .
CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40 % of rats , but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5 - FU and MTX .
Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX , CY and NG , while no such change was observed after 5 - FU and joint administration of MTX + 5 - FU + CY compared to controls .
Our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of MTX + 5 - FU + CY administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy .
