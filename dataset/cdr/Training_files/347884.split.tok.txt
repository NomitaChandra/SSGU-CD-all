Clinical experiences in an open and a double - blind trial .
A total of sixty patients were trated with bromperidol first in open conditions ( 20 patients ) , then on a double blind basis ( 40 patients ) with haloperidol as the reference substance .
The open study lasted for four weeks ; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets .
The daily dose ( initial dose : 1 mg ; mean dose at the end of the trial : 4 . 47 mg ) was always administered in one single dose .
Nineteen patients finished the trial , and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good .
These results were confirmed by statistical analysis .
Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms ; no other side effects were observed .
The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects .
In the double blind study with haloperidol , both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of psychotic syndromes belonging predominantly to the schizophrenia group .
Certain clues , including the onset of action , seem to be indicative of the superiority of bromperidol .
No differences were observed with respect to side effects and general tolerability .
