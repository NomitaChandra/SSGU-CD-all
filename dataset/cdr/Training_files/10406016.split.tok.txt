Effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats .
Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke .
Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke .
We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan , which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage , in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus .
Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan ( 30 micrograms h - 1 ) or vehicle .
The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging .
Motor behavior , passive avoidance , and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks .
Fucoidan - treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution , had larger hematomas , and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days .
They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test .
Acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups .
Investigation of more specific anti - inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage .
