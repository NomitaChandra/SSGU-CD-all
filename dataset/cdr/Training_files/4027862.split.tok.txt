Desipramine - induced delirium at " subtherapeutic " concentrations : a case report .
An elderly patient treated with low dose Desipramine developed a delirium while her plasma level was in the " subtherapeutic " range .
Delirium , which may be induced by tricyclic drug therapy in the elderly , can be caused by tricyclics with low anticholinergic potency .
Therapeutic ranges for antidepressants that have been derived from general adult population studies may not be appropriate for the elderly .
Further studies of specifically elderly patients are now required to establish safer and more appropriate guidelines for drug therapy .
