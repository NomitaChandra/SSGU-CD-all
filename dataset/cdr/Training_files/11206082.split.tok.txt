Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta - carboline - induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other GABA ( A ) receptor ligands .
Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity ( BS line ) or resistance ( BR line ) to seizures induced by a single i . p .
injection of methyl beta - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( beta - CCM ) , an inverse agonist of the GABA ( A ) receptor benzodiazepine site .
Our aim was to characterize both lines ' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA ( A ) receptor .
We measured diazepam - induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus - maze test , diazepam - induced sedation by recording the vigilance states , and picrotoxin - and pentylenetetrazol - induced seizures after i . p .
injections .
Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to beta - CCM can be extended to diazepam , picrotoxin , and pentylenetetrazol , suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the GABA ( A ) receptor .
