Anaesthetists' nightmare: masseter spasm after induction in an undiagnosed case of myotonia congenita.
We report an undiagnosed case of myotonia congenita in a 24-year-old previously healthy primigravida, who developed life threatening masseter spasm following a standard dose of intravenous suxamethonium for induction of anaesthesia.
Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist was aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred.
