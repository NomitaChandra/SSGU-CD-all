Indomethacin - induced renal insufficiency : recurrence on rechallenge .
We have reported a case of acute oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis , ascites , and cor pulmonale after indomethacin therapy .
Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal , while re - exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria .
Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished .
Since nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure , they should be used with caution in such patients .
