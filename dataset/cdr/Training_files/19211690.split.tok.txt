Testosterone - dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt - sensitive rats .
Blood pressure ( BP ) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women .
In Dahl salt - sensitive rats ( DS ) , high - salt ( HS ) diet increases BP more in males than females .
In contrast to the systemic renin - angiotensin system , which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS , intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased , and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed .
In this study , the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS - induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal injury .
On a low - salt ( LS ) diet , male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females .
HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS , which was prevented by castration .
Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet .
Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet .
HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP , protein and albumin excretion , and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats , which were attenuated by castration .
Testosterone replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP , renal injury , and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet .
Testosterone contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin - angiotensin system .
