Effects of tetrandrine and fangchinoline on experimental thrombosis in mice and human platelet aggregation .
Tetrandrine ( TET ) and fangchinoline ( FAN ) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bisbenzylisoquinoline structure .
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine ( EP ) in mice , and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro .
In the in vivo study , the administration ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55 % and 35 % , respectively , while acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA , 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) , a positive control , showed only 30 % inhibition .
In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests , TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently .
In addition , neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) and thrombin time ( TT ) using human - citrated plasma .
These results suggest that antithrombosis of TET and FAN in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities .
