Comparison of i.v.
glycopyrrolate and atropine in the prevention of bradycardia and arrhythmias following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children.
The effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v.
immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children, was studied.
A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine.
A frequency of bradycardia of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs.
Bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used.
It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg-1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v.
should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated.
