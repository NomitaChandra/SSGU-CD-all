Bile duct hamartoma occurring in association with long-term treatment with danazol.
We report a case of bile duct hamartoma which developed in a patient who had been on long-term danazol treatment.
Such patients should be under close follow-up, preferably with periodic ultrasound examination of the liver.
If the patient develops a liver mass, because of non-specific clinical features and imaging appearances, biopsy may be the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis.
