Protection against amphetamine - induced neurotoxicity toward striatal dopamine neurons in rodents by LY274614 , an excitatory amino acid antagonist .
LY274614 , 3SR , 4aRS , 6SR , 8aRS - 6 - [ phosphonomethyl ] decahydr oisoquinoline - 3 - carboxylic acid , has been described as a potent antagonist of the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) subtype of glutamate receptor .
Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole - treated rats is reported .
A single 18 . 4 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose of ( + / - ) - amphetamine hemisulfate , given to rats pretreated with iprindole , resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later .
This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine ( MK - 801 , a non - competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors ) or by LY274614 ( a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors ) .
The protective effect of LY274614 was dose - dependent , being maximum at 10 - 40 mgkg ( i . p . ) .
A 10 mg / kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum , when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine .
Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine ; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine .
The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice , given multiple injections of methamphetamine , was also antagonized dose - dependently and completely by LY274614 .
The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long - lasting in vivo effects in rats .
