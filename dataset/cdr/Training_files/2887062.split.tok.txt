Immunohistochemical , electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen - induced rat prolactinomas after bromocriptine treatment .
To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo , immunohistochemical , ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen - induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine ( 3 mg / kg of body weight ) .
One h after treatment , serum prolactin levels decreased markedly .
Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules , slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum , and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells .
Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased , while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased .
These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules .
At 6 h after injection , serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls .
The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated , with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae .
Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules , Golgi cisternae , and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells .
However , only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells .
An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis , suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion .
