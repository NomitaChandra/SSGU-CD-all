Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously .
Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured .
Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed .
Isoproterenol - treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate transaminase , creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart .
These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure , maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure , and elevation of left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and ST - segment .
In addition , mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP / O was observed in isoproterenol - treated rats .
Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol - induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function .
The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination .
The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction .
