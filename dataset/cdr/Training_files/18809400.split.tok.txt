Alpha - lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy .
The study investigates if alpha - lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity , if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade , and if neuroprotective effects of alpha - lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection .
We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin , two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs .
This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha - lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha - lipoic acid .
Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons .
Alpha - lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons : it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin , an essential mitochondrial protein with anti - oxidant and chaperone properties .
In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity .
Alpha - lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti - oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions , possibly inducing the expression of frataxin .
These findings suggest that alpha - lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials .
