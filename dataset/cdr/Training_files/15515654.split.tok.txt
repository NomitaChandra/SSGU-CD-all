Long term audiological evaluation of beta - thalassemic patients .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of hearing loss in children and young adults with beta - thalassemia major .
METHODS : One hundred and four ( 104 ) patients aged 6 - 35 years ( mean 17 , 2 years ) participated in the study .
All patients were on a regular transfusion - chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9 . 5 gr / dl .
Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine ( DFO ) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50 - 60 mg / kg , 5 - 6 days a week during the first six years of the study , which was then reduced to 40 - 50 mg / kg for the following eight years .
Patients were followed for 8 - 14 years .
RESULTS : Overall , 21 out of 104 patients ( 20 . 2 % ) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) , either unilateral or bilateral .
No ototoxic factor , other than DFO , was present in any of the patients .
Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing , however , no statistically significant difference was observed .
Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal .
Following intervention , 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered , 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation .
CONCLUSION : The findings are indicative of DFO 's contributing role in the development of hearing impairment .
Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all thalassemic patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse hearing impairment .
