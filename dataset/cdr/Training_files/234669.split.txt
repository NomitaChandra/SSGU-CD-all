Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure.
Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure.
The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized.
The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs.
The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle.
During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits.
When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level.
These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure, pharmacologic agents, particularly aminophylline, may play a significant role.
