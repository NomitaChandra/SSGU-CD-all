Components of lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced by scopolamine .
The anti - dementia effects of s - limonene and s - perillyl alcohol were observed using the passive avoidance test ( PA ) and the open field habituation test ( OFH ) .
These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory impaired by scopolamine ; however , s - perillyl alcohol relieved the deficit of associative memory in PA only , and did not improve non - associative memory significantly in OFH .
Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that dopamine concentration of the vehicle / scopolamine group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle / vehicle group , but this phenomenon was reversed when s - limonene or s - perillyl alcohol were administered before the injection of scopolamine .
Simultaneously , we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method .
