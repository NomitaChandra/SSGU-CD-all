Variant ventricular tachycardia in desipramine toxicity .
We report a case of variant ventricular tachycardia induced by desipramine toxicity .
Unusual features of the arrhythmia are repetitive group beating , progressive shortening of the R - R interval , progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction , and changes in direction of the QRS axis .
Recognition of variant ventricular tachycardia is important because therapy differs from that of classic ventricular tachycardia .
