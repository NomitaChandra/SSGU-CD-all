Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE , bupivacaine , and low pH normal saline in dogs .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE in experimental animals .
The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing neurotoxicity was evaluated .
The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows : 6 to 8 ml of bupivacaine ( N = 15 ) , 2 - chloroprocaine - CE ( N = 20 ) , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) ( N = 20 ) , or normal saline ( N = 10 ) .
Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2 - chloroprocaine - CE seven ( 35 % ) developed hind - limb paralysis .
None of the animals that received bupivacaine , normal saline , or normal saline titrated to a pH 3 . 0 developed hind - limb paralysis .
Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2 - chloroprocaine - CE , 13 showed subpial necrosis ; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal .
The spinal cords of the animals that received bupivacaine , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) , or normal saline did not show abnormal findings .
