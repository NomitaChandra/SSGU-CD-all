Assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia.
METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test.
Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level.
In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT.
The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group.
dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone.
RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%.
CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.
