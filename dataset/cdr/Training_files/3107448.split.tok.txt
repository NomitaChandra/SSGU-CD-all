Glyburide - induced hepatitis .
Drug - induced hepatotoxicity , although common , has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas .
For glyburide , a second - generation sulfonylurea , only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist .
Two patients with type II diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis - like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy .
There was no serologic evidence of viral infection , and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug - induced hepatitis .
Both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow - up period of 1 year .
Glyburide can produce an acute hepatitis - like illness in some persons .
