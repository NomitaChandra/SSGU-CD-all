Prazosin - induced stress incontinence .
A case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin , a common antihypertensive drug , is presented .
Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors .
As an alpha - blocker , it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra .
The patient 's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil .
Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication .
The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure , maximum urethral closure pressure , and functional urethral length .
Patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery , because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy .
