Synthesis of N-pyrimidinyl-2-phenoxyacetamides as adenosine A2A receptor antagonists.
A series of N-pyrimidinyl-2-phenoxyacetamide adenosine A(2A) antagonists is described.
SAR studies led to compound 14 with excellent potency (K(i) = 0.4 nM), selectivity (A(1)/A(2A) > 100), and efficacy (MED 10 mg/kg p.o.) in the rat haloperidol-induced catalepsy model for Parkinson's disease.
