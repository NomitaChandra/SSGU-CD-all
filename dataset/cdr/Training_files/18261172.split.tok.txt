Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus - based immunosuppression in long - term cardiac transplant patients .
Calcineurin - inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients .
The novel immunosuppressive ( IS ) drug sirolmus ( Srl ) lacks nephrotoxic effects ; however , proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation .
In cardiac transplantation , the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown .
In this study , long - term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl - based IS .
Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil + / - steroids .
Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0 . 13 g / day ( range 0 - 5 . 7 ) preswitch to 0 . 23 g / day ( 0 - 9 . 88 ) at 24 months postswitch ( p = 0 . 0024 ) .
Before the switch , 11 . 5 % of patients had high - grade proteinuria ( > 1 . 0 g / day ) ; this increased to 22 . 9 % postswitch ( p = 0 . 006 ) .
ACE inhibitor and angiotensin - releasing blocker ( ARB ) therapy reduced proteinuria development .
Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function ( median 42 . 5 vs . 64 . 1 , p = 0 . 25 ) , whereas patients who developed high - grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow - up ( median 39 . 6 vs . 29 . 2 , p = 0 . 125 ) .
Thus , proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl , which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients .
Srl should be used with ACEi / ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction .
