Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia - induced hypotension .
BACKGROUND : Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia - induced hypotension .
We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) following anesthesia - induced hypotension .
METHODS : Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl ( 0 . 15 mg kg ( - 1 ) ) and propofol ( 2 . 0 mg kg ( - 1 ) ) , 13 patients received phenylephrine ( 0 . 1 mg iv ) and 12 patients received ephedrine ( 10 mg iv ) to restore mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) .
Heart rate ( HR ) , MAP , stroke volume ( SV ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , and frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) were registered .
RESULTS : Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP , HR , SV , and CO concomitant with an elevation in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .
After administration of phenylephrine , MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ; mean + / - SD ) .
However , a 14 % ( from 70 + / - 8 % to 60 + / - 7 % ) reduction in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) followed with no change in CO ( 3 . 7 + / - 1 . 1 to 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 9 l min ( - 1 ) ) .
The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ) , restored CO ( 3 . 2 + / - 1 . 2 to 5 . 0 + / - 1 . 3 l min ( - 1 ) ) , and preserved S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S ( c ) O ( 2 ) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO .
