Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats .
Reserpine - and haloperidol - induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress .
In the present study , the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats .
Reserpine injection ( one dose of 1 mg / kg s . c . ) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching , compared to the control .
Haloperidol administration ( one dose of 12 mg / kg once a week s . c . ) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations .
After the treatments and behavioral observation , glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed .
A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol , compared to the control .
Importantly , a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia .
These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats .
