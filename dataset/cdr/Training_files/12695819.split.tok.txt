MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus - induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients .
Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion - weighted ( DW ) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy .
Brain MR studies , including DW imaging , were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications .
In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study , a follow - up MR study was performed 1 month later .
Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions .
Of the 14 patients , 5 ( 35 . 7 % ) had white matter abnormalities , 1 ( 7 . 1 % ) had putaminal hemorrhage , and 8 ( 57 . 1 % ) had normal findings on initial MR images .
Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities , 4 patients ( 80 . 0 % ) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images , and all showed complete resolution on follow - up images .
The remaining 1 patient ( 20 . 0 % ) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis .
Diffusion - weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus - induced neurotoxicity .
