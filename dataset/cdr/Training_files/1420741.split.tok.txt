Treatment of Crohn 's disease with fusidic acid : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin .
Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T - cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin .
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn 's disease , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active , therapy - resistant patients .
Eight Crohn 's disease patients were included .
Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t . d . s .
and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks .
The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score .
Five of 8 patients ( 63 % ) improved during fusidic acid treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks .
There were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea .
Biochemically , an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63 % ) , and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment .
All reversed to pre - treatment levels after cessation of treatment .
The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn 's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective .
Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .
