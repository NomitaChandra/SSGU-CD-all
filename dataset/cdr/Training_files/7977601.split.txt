Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan.
PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography.
METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera.
RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992.
Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions.
For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing.
The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution.
There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment.
Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension.
The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock.
CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography.
