In a patient with WPW syndrome and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy , intractable atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia ( AVRT ) was iatrogenically induced .
QRS without preexcitation , caused by junctional escape beats after verapamil or unidirectional antegrade block of accessory pathway after catheter ablation , established frequent AVRT attack .
