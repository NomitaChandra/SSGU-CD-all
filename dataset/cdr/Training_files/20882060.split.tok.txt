Effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy : behavioral and electrophysiological studies .
OBJECTIVE : The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation .
Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum , and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects .
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol - induced parkinsonian symptoms .
METHODS : Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study .
RESULTS : Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol - induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats .
Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration .
The neurotensin type - 1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin .
CONCLUSION : Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin - induced antiparkinsonian effects .
