Dup 753 prevents the development of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis .
The appearance of nephrotic syndromes such as proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , hypercholesterolemia and increase in blood nitrogen urea , induced in rats by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside was markedly inhibited by oral administration of Dup 753 ( losartan ) , a novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist , at a dose of 1 or 2 mg / kg per day .
The results suggest a possible involvement of the renin - angiotensin system in the development of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis .
