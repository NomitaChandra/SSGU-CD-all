Ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia : report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature .
In this study , three Chinese patients with ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed .
We attempted to find underlying similarities , evaluate the risk factors , and identify appropriate treatment for this complication .
All but one of the patients were over 60 years old , and the 6 who died were all older than 65 .
Therefore , old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication .
Agranulocytosis occurred 3 - 20 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine , so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended .
There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of bone marrow suppression .
Treatment for ticlopidine - induced aplastic anemia with colony - stimulating factors seemed to have little effect .
The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent calcium channel blockers died , should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously .
