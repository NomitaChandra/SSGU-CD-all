Carmofur-induced organic mental disorders.
Organic mental disorder was observed in a 29-year-old female in the prognostic period after the onset of carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy.
Symptoms such as euphoria, emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as organic personality syndrome according to the criteria defined in the DSM-III-R.
It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome.
Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns.
Consequently, carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state.
It may be attributed to the structural damage to the frontal lobe.
