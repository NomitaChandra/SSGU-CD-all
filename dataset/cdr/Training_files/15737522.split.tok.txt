Ceftriaxone - associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients .
It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients .
Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction , such as fasting , may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis .
In this study , we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment , who often had to fast in the post - operative period .
Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms .
Of those , 13 ( 26 % ) developed biliary pathology .
Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age , sex , duration of the treatment and starvation variables .
After cessation of the treatment , pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period .
The incidence of pseudolithiasis is not affected by fasting .
