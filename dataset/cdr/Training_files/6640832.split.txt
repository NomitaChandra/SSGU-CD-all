Early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma.
A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
Adriamycin (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T1 (O-A) bladder tumors.
Instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year.
The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients, and 29 patients presented with local side-effects.
In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study.
No systemic side-effects were observed.
Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow-up and in 72 patients followed for 2-3 years (mean 32 months).
Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease.
Of the 82 evaluable patients, 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year (61%), while 32 presented with one or more recurrences (39%).
Of these recurrences, 27 were T1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions.
In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80% remained tumor-free during the 2- to 3-year follow-up period.
Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year, only 50% presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped.
The beneficial effect of Adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after TUR, or both.
