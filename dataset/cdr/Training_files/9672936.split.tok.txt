Pethidine - associated seizure in a healthy adolescent receiving pethidine for postoperative pain control .
A healthy 17 - year - old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient - controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump for management of postoperative pain control .
Twenty - three h postoperatively he developed a brief self - limited seizure .
Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation .
No other risk factors for CNS toxicity were identified .
This method allowed frequent self - dosing of pethidine at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine .
The routine use of pethidine via PCA even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered .
