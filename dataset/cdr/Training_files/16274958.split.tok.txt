Recurrent dysphonia and acitretin .
We report the case of a woman complaining of dysphonia while she was treated by acitretin .
Her symptoms totally regressed after drug withdrawal and reappeared when acitretin was reintroduced .
To our knowledge , this is the first case of acitretin - induced dysphonia .
This effect may be related to the pharmacological effect of this drug on mucous membranes .
