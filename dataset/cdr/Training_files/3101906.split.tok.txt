Hepatic reactions associated with ketoconazole in the United Kingdom .
Ketoconazole was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981 .
By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug , including five deaths .
An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16 , including three deaths , were probably related to treatment with the drug .
Of the remainder , 48 were possibly related to treatment , five were unlikely to be so , and six were unclassifiable .
The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57 . 9 , with hepatotoxicity being more common in women .
The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days .
None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment .
The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 ( 63 % ) ; the rest showed a mixed pattern .
In contrast , the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis .
The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar .
Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare .
Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped , with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3 . 1 months .
In two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis .
Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is advised during long term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious hepatic injury .
