Changes in depressive status associated with topical beta - blockers .
Depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta - blockers .
We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta - blocker ( timolol ) and a selective beta - blocker ( betaxolol ) regarding CNS side effects .
Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0 . 5 % / 12h , suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS - III - R criteria , were included in the study .
During the six - month follow up , depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung - Conde scales every two months .
In a double blind cross - over study with control group , the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung - Conde scales ( p < 0 . 001 vs control ) .
These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression - inducer than timolol in predisposed patients .
