Cerebral infarction with a single oral dose of phenylpropanolamine.
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a synthetic sympathomimetic that is structurally similar to amphetamine, is available over the counter in anorectics, nasal congestants, and cold preparations.
Its prolonged use or overuse has been associated with seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction.
We report the case of a young woman who suffered a cerebral infarction after taking a single oral dose of PPA.
