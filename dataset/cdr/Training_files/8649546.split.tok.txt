Improvement of levodopa - induced dyskinesia by propranolol in Parkinson 's disease .
Seven patients suffering from Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) with severely disabling dyskinesia received low - dose propranolol as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment .
There was a significant 40 % improvement in the dyskinesia score without increase of parkinsonian motor disability .
Ballistic and choreic dyskinesia were markedly ameliorated , whereas dystonia was not .
This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta - blockers may improve levodopa - induced ballistic and choreic dyskinesia in PD .
