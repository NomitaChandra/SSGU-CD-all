Sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction .
In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication , we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications .
A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0 . 2 ml .
of a combination of 3 drugs : 6 mg .
papaverine , 100 micrograms .
phentolamine and 10 micrograms .
prostaglandin E1 with ( pH 7 . 05 ) or without ( pH 4 . 17 ) the addition of sodium bicarbonate ( 0 . 03 mEq . ) .
Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 ( 58 % ) complained of penile pain due to the medication , while only 1 of the 19 men ( 5 % ) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain .
From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication , which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level .
