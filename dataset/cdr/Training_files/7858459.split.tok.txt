Acute confusion induced by a high - dose infusion of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid .
A 61 - year - old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum , etoposide , high - dose 5 - fluorouracil ( 2 , 250 mg / m2 / 24 hours ) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma .
He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion , disorientation and irritability , and then lapsed into a deep coma , lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose ( day 2 ) of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion .
This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5 - fluorouracil and folinic acid , which were then the only drugs given .
Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition , neurotoxicity due to high - dose 5 - fluorouracil was highly suspected .
The pathogenesis of 5 - fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate , thiamine deficiency , or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency .
High - dose 5 - fluorouracil / folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers .
It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication .
