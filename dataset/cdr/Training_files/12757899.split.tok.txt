Estradiol reduces seizure - induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats .
Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid - induced status epilepticus ( SE ) .
We compared the effects of 17beta - estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium - pilocarpine - induced SE .
Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta - estradiol ( 2 microg / rat ) or oil once daily for four consecutive days .
SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later .
The extent of silver - stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE .
17beta - Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males .
17beta - Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3 - C sectors of ovariectomized rats .
In males , estradiol increased the total damage score .
These findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex - related differences in the hormonal environment .
