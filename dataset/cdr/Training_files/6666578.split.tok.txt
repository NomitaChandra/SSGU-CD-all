D - penicillamine - induced angiopathy in rats .
The effect of high dose D - penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel .
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with D - penicillamine ( D - pen ) 500 mg / kg / day for 10 or 42 days .
Pair fed rats served as controls .
Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light - and transmission - electron microscopy ( TEM ) .
In addition , the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes , 24 and 48 hours after i .
v .
injection of human serum 131I - albumin ( 131I - HSA ) .
TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D - pen - treated rats , consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation .
In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall , together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells .
The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with D - pen for 42 days , indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate .
The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D - pen , and no differences in aortic 131I - HSA radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection , indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D - pen treatment .
These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D - pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta , possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross - linking of collagen and elastin .
