Chronic active hepatitis associated with diclofenac sodium therapy.
Diclofenac sodium (Voltarol, Geigy Pharmaceuticals) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory derivative of phenylacetic acid.
Although generally well-tolerated, asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function have been recorded and, less commonly, severe hepatitis induced by diclofenac.
The patient described developed chronic active hepatitis after six months therapy with diclofenac sodium which progressed despite the withdrawal of the drug, a finding not previously reported.
