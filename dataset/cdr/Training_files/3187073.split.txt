Adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with cis-platin and 5-fluorouracil.
Survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and/or surgery.
Obviously, there is a need for effective chemotherapy.
In the present study, cis-platin (80-120 mg/m2BSA) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery.
The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment.
Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed.
In the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients (43%).
During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%).
The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years.
The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation.
The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain, ST-T wave changes and atrial fibrillation.
This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another.
It is concluded that patients on 5-FU treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed.
