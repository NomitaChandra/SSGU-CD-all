Encephalopathy induced by levetiracetam added to valproate.
BACKGROUND: We report on the manifestation of a levetiracetam (LEV)-induced encephalopathy.
FINDINGS: A 28-year-old man suffering from idiopathic epilepsy with generalized seizures was treated with LEV (3000 mg) added to valproate (VPA) (2000 mg).
Frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures increased from one per 6 months to two per month.
Neuropsychological testing showed impaired word fluency, psychomotor speed and working memory.
The interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a generalized slowing to 5 per second theta rhythms with bilateral generalized high-amplitude discharges.
OUTCOME: Following discontinuation of LEV, EEG and neuropsychological findings improved and seizure frequency decreased.
