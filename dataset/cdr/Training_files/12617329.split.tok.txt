The effect of treatment with gum Arabic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats : a preliminary study .
In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum Arabic on acute renal failure induced by gentamicin ( GM ) nephrotoxicity .
Rats were treated with the vehicle ( 2 mL / kg of distilled water and 5 % w / v cellulose , 10 days ) , gum Arabic ( 2 mL / kg of a 10 % w / v aqueous suspension of gum Arabic powder , orally for 10 days ) , or gum Arabic concomitantly with GM ( 80mg / kg / day intramuscularly , during the last six days of the treatment period ) .
Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) in the kidney cortex , and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections .
The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239 % , respectively ( compared to 432 and 346 % , respectively , in rats treated with cellulose and GM ) , and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21 % ( compared to 27 % in the cellulose plus GM group ) The GM - induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose .
It could be inferred that gum Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity .
Further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of chronic renal failure , and on the mechanism ( s ) involved .
