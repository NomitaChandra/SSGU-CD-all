Persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids .
Neuromuscular blocking agents ( NMBAs ) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation .
Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid - based NMBAs such as vecuronium bromide , especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids .
Atracurium besylate , a short - acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function , has also been associated with persistent paralysis , but only when used with corticosteroids .
We report a case of atracurium - related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids .
