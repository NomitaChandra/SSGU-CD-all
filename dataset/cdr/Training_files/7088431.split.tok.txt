Development of clear cell adenocarcinoma in DES - exposed offspring under observation .
Two cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina detected at follow - up in young women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol are reported .
One patient , aged 23 , had been followed for 2 years before carcinoma was diagnosed ; the second patient , aged 22 , had been seen on a regular basis for 5 years , 8 months .
In both instances , suspicion of the presence of carcinoma was aroused by the palpation of a small nodule in the vaginal fornix .
Hysterosalpingography was performed on both patients and , in 1 instance , an abnormal x - ray film was reflected by the gross appearance of the uterine cavity found in the surgical specimen .
