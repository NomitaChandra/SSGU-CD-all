Prolonged cholestasis after troleandomycin - induced acute hepatitis .
We report the case of a patient in whom troleandomycin - induced hepatitis was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis .
Jaundice occurred after administration of troleandomycin for 7 days and was associated with hypereosinophilia .
Jaundice disappeared within 3 months but was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis marked by pruritus and high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities .
Finally , pruritus disappeared within 19 months , and liver tests returned to normal 27 months after the onset of hepatitis .
This observation demonstrates that prolonged cholestasis can follow troleandomycin - induced acute hepatitis .
