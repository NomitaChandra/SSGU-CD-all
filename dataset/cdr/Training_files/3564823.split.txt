Drug-induced arterial spasm relieved by lidocaine.
Case report.
Following major intracranial surgery in a 35-year-old man, sodium pentothal was intravenously infused to minimize cerebral ischaemia.
Intense vasospasm with threatened gangrene arose in the arm used for the infusion.
Since the cranial condition precluded use of more usual methods, lidocaine was given intra-arterially, with careful cardiovascular monitoring, to counteract the vasospasm.
The treatment was rapidly successful.
