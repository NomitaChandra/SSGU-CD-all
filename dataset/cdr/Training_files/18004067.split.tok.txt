Acute liver failure in two patients with regular alcohol consumption ingesting paracetamol at therapeutic dosage .
BACKGROUND : The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) is currently debated .
CASE REPORT : We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3 - 5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with 4 g paracetamol / day .
A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range .
Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed .
CONCLUSION : In patients with risk factors , e . g .
regular consumption of alcohol , liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested .
We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g / day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with paracetamol .
