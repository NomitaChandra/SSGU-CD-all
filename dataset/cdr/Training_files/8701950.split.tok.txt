Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia complicating FK506 ( tacrolimus ) therapy .
We describe 3 episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( MAHA ) in 2 solid organ recipients under FK506 ( tacrolimus ) therapy .
In both cases , discontinuation of FK506 and treatment with plasma exchange , fresh frozen plasma replacement , corticosteroids , aspirin , and dipyridamole led to resolution of MAHA .
In one patient , reintroduction of FK506 led to rapid recurrence of MAHA .
FK506 - associated MAHA is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication .
In our experience and according to the literature , FK506 does not seem to cross - react with cyclosporin A ( CyA ) , an immuno - suppressive drug already known to induce MAHA .
