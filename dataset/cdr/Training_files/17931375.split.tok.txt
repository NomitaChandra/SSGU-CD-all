A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain .
AIM : This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin .
BACKGROUND : Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented .
DESIGN : This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research .
METHOD : The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered .
Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .
Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .
Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .
The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period .
Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation .
RESULTS : The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection .
It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection .
Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .
CONCLUSIONS : It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin .
This study should be repeated on a larger sample .
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE : When administering subcutaneous heparin injections , it is important to extend the duration of the injection .
