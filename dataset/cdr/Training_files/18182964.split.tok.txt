Clonidine for attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder : II .
ECG changes and adverse events analysis .
OBJECTIVE : To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
METHOD : In a 16 - week multicenter , double - blind trial , 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine ( n = 31 ) , methylphenidate ( n = 29 ) , clonidine and methylphenidate ( n = 32 ) , or placebo ( n = 30 ) .
Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0 . 6 mg / day for clonidine and 60 mg / day for methylphenidate ( both with divided dosing ) .
Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs .
RESULTS : There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine ( 17 . 5 % versus 3 . 4 % ; p = . 02 ) , but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes .
There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes .
Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine ( 79 . 4 % versus 49 . 2 % ; p = . 0006 ) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal .
Drowsiness was common on clonidine , but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks .
CONCLUSIONS : Clonidine , used alone or with methylphenidate , appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD .
Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness .
