Suxamethonium - induced cardiac arrest and death following 5 days of immobilization .
The present report describes a case of cardiac arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyperkalaemia following the use of suxamethonium in a 23 - year - old Malawian woman .
Five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis , the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation .
Forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium , bradycardia and cardiac arrest occurred .
Attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful .
The serum level of potassium was observed to be 8 . 4 mequiv L - 1 .
Apart from the reduction in the patient 's level of consciousness , there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyperkalaemia following the administration of suxamethonium .
It is postulated that her death was caused by hypersensitivity to suxamethonium , associated with her 5 - day immobilization .
