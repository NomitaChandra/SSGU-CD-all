Effect of green tea and vitamin E combination in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats .
The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of green tea and vitamin E on heart weight , body weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation , endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in isoproterenol ( ISO ) - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
Adult male albino rats , treated with ISO ( 200 mg / kg , s . c . ) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) elevation of heart weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation and Ca + 2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in body weight , endogenous antioxidants , Na + / K + ATPase and Mg + 2 ATPase levels .
Administration of green tea ( 100 mg / kg / day , p . o . ) and vitamin E ( 100 mg / kg / day , p . o . ) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with ISO on the day 29th and 30th , showed a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in heart weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation , Ca + 2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight , endogenous antioxidants , Na + / K + ATPase and Mg + 2 ATPase when compared with ISO treated group and green tea or vitamin E alone treated groups .
These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of green tea and vitamin E during ISO induced myocardial infarction in rats .
