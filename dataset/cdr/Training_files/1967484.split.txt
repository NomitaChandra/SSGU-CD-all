Sulpiride-induced tardive dystonia.
Sulpiride is a selective D2-receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant properties.
Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, sulpiride-induced tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occasionally.
We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therapy.
We could not find any previous reports of sulpiride-induced tardive dystonia.
