Warfarin - induced iliopsoas hemorrhage with subsequent femoral nerve palsy .
We present the case of a 28 - year - old man on chronic warfarin therapy who sustained a minor muscle tear and developed increasing pain and a flexure contracture of the right hip .
Surgical exploration revealed an iliopsoas hematoma and femoral nerve entrapment , resulting in a femoral nerve palsy and partial loss of quadriceps functions .
Anticoagulant - induced femoral nerve palsy represents the most common form of warfarin - induced peripheral neuropathy ; it is characterized by severe pain in the inguinal region , varying degrees of motor and sensory impairment , and flexure contracture of the involved extremity .
