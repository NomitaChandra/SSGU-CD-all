The role of nicotine in smoking - related cardiovascular disease .
Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease .
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect .
Almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide .
Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans .
Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events .
Finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low - level cigarette exposures .
