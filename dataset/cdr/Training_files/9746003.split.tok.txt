Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures .
Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures .
Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only , eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add - on .
Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children .
Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks , which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine .
Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment .
Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate , lamotrigine , or ethosuximide alone or in combination .
