Attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride in rats.
The effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl.
Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment.
6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied.
At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels.
After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake.
In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level.
It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.
