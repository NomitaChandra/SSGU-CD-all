Dipyridamole - induced myocardial ischemia .
Angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures .
To our knowledge , this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy , although dipyridamole - induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with coronary artery disease .
Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients ; a coronary " steal " phenomenon may be the mechanism of the dipyridamole - induced ischemia observed .
