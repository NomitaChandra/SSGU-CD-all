A double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of dothiepin hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive disorder.
In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients.
Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness, and both were significantly superior to placebo.
The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred vision, dry mouth, and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline.
Dothiepin also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects.
There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters.
Dothiepin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients.
