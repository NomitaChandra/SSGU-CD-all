Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate protects the piriform cortex in the pilocarpine status epilepticus model .
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa - beta .
Both , production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF - kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub - regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices .
The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus - associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model .
Treatment with 150 mg / kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100 % .
Administration of 50 mg / kg PDTC ( low - dose ) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate .
In vehicle - treated rats , status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons .
Low - dose PDTC treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex .
A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle - and PDTC - treated rats following status epilepticus .
In conclusion , the NF - kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex , whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss .
These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF - kappaB plays a more central role in seizure - associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus .
However , future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which PDTC exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex .
