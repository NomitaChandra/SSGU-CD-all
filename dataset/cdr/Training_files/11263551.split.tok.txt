Calcineurin - inhibitor induced pain syndrome ( CIPS ) : a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation .
Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases .
Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain .
Nine patients with severe pain in their feet , which was registered after transplantation , were investigated .
Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones .
Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones .
Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain , like reflex sympathetic dystrophy , polyneuropathy , Morton 's neuralgia , gout , osteoporosis , avascular necrosis , intermittent claudication , orthopaedic foot deformities , stress fractures , and hyperparathyroidism .
The reduction of cyclosporine - or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain .
The Calcineurin - inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome ( CIPS ) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation , magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans .
Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS .
