Seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of venlafaxine overdose.
CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt.
After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure.
She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure.
Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted.
CONCLUSIONS: The venlafaxine overdose in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized seizure but elicited no further sequelae.
