Differential effects of systemically administered ketamine and lidocaine on dynamic and static hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans .
We have examined the effect of systemic administration of ketamine and lidocaine on brush - evoked ( dynamic ) pain and punctate - evoked ( static ) hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin .
In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover study , we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments .
Capsaicin 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i . v .
infusion of ketamine ( bolus 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg - 1 min - 1 ) , lidocaine 5 mg kg - 1 or saline for 50 min .
Infusion started 15 min after injection of capsaicin .
The following were measured : spontaneous pain , pain evoked by punctate and brush stimuli ( VAS ) , and areas of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia .
Ketamine reduced both the area of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush - evoked pain .
Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate - evoked hyperalgesia significantly .
It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain .
The differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology .
