Reversible dilated cardiomyopathy related to amphotericin B therapy.
We describe a patient who developed dilated cardiomyopathy and clinical congestive heart failure after 2 months of therapy with amphotericin B (AmB) for disseminated coccidioidomycosis.
His echocardiographic abnormalities and heart failure resolved after posaconazole was substituted for AmB.
It is important to recognize the rare and potentially reversible toxicity of AmB.
