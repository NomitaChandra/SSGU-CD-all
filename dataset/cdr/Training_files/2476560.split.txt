Is the treatment of scabies hazardous?
Treatment for scabies is usually initiated by general practitioners; most consider lindane (gamma benzene hexachloride) the treatment of choice.
Lindane is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide, and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood.
Evidence is accumulating that lindane can be toxic to the central nervous system and may be associated with aplastic anaemia.
Preparations containing lindane continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patients.
This literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe scabicides with increased caution for certain at-risk groups, and give adequate warnings regarding potential toxicity.
