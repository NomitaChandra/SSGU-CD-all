Clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin .
A prospective study .
Nearly 3 . 2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually .
Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies .
In this study , 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg / kg / day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside - related renal failure , defined as at least a one - third reduction in renal function .
In these 62 patients , no other causes for renal failure could be identified .
Five of 33 ( 15 % ) of the tobramycin - treated patients and 16 of 29 ( 55 . 2 % ) of the gentamicin - treated patients had renal failure .
Thus , gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin .
