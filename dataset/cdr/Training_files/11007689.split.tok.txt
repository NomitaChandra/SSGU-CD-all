Cyclosporine and tacrolimus - associated thrombotic microangiopathy .
The development of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented .
Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange , plasma infusion , anticoagulation , and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion .
However , for recipients of organ transplantation , removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss .
The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine .
As a result , switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine - induced TMA .
With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation , tacrolimus - associated TMA has also been recognized .
However , literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited .
We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine - induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy .
Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft .
Patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent TMA .
