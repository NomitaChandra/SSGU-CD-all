A 63 - year - old male experienced sudden diplopia after 9 weeks of administration of pegylated interferon ( IFN ) alpha - 2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) .
Ophthalmologic examinations showed ptosis on the right upper lid and restricted right eye movement without any other neurological signs .
A brain imaging study and repetitive nerve stimulation test indicated no abnormality .
The acetylcholine receptor antibody titer and response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were negative , and the results of thyroid function tests were normal .
The patient 's ophthalmological symptoms improved rapidly 3 weeks after discontinuation of pegylated IFN alpha - 2b and ribavirin .
