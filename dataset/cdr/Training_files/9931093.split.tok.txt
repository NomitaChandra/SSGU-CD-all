Mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension in the rat .
- Tacrolimus ( FK 506 ) is a powerful , widely used immunosuppressant .
The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity .
To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506 - induced hypertension , we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1 ) , the expression of mRNA of ET - 1 and endothelin - converting enzyme - 1 ( ECE - 1 ) , the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) activity , and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C - type natriuretic peptide ( CNP ) in rat blood vessels .
In addition , the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats was studied .
FK 506 , 5 mg .
kg - 1 .
d - 1 given for 4 weeks , elevated blood pressure from 102 + / - 13 to 152 + / - 15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET - 1 and the levels of ET - 1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery ( 240 % and 230 % , respectively ) .
Little change was observed in the expression of ECE - 1 mRNA and CNP mRNA .
FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta ( 48 % and 55 % , respectively ) .
The administration of FR 139317 ( 10 mg .
kg - 1 .
d - 1 ) prevented FK 506 - induced hypertension in rats .
These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET - 1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature .
