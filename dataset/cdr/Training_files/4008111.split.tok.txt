Amiodarone - induced sinoatrial block .
We observed sinoatrial block due to chronic amiodarone administration in a 5 - year - old boy with primary cardiomyopathy , Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome and supraventricular tachycardia .
Reduction in the dosage of amiodarone resulted in the disappearance of the sinoatrial block and the persistence of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia .
