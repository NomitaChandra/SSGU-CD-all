Mediation of enhanced reflex vagal bradycardia by L - dopa via central dopamine formation in dogs .
L - Dopa ( 5 mg / kg i . v . ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with MK - 486 ( 25 mg / kg i . v . ) in anesthetize MAO - inhibited dogs .
In addition , reflex bradycardia caused by injected norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by L - dopa , DL - Threo - dihydroxyphenylserine had no effect on blood pressure , heart rate or reflex responses to norepinephrine .
FLA - 63 , a dopamine - beta - oxidase inhibitor , did not have any effect on the hypotension , bradycardia or reflex - enhancing effect of L - dopa .
Pimozide did not affect the actions of L - dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes .
Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of norepinephrine .
However , L - dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate .
5 - HTP ( 5 mg / kg i . v . ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to norepinephrine .
It is concluded that L - dopa enhances reflex bradycardia through central alpha - receptor stimulation .
Furthermore , the effects are mediated through dopamine rather than norepinephrine and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors .
