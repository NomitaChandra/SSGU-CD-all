Salvage therapy with nelarabine , etoposide , and cyclophosphamide in relapsed / refractory paediatric T - cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma .
A combination of 5 d of nelarabine ( AraG ) with 5 d of etoposide ( VP ) and cyclophosphamide ( CPM ) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T - cell leukaemia or lymphoma .
The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain .
Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone , although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies .
All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG / VP / CPM .
Our experience supports the safety of giving AraG as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide , although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored .
