Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy.
Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as indomethacin.
Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac, owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis.
We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration.
In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac.
As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia.
These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified.
