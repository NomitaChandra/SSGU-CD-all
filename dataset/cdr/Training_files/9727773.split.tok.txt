High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium .
Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare , progressive and incurable disease , which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs .
The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants .
Thirty - five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months ( 1992 - 1994 ) in Belgium .
Exposure to appetite - suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview .
Twenty - three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants , mainly fenfluramines , as compared with only 5 of the controls ( 66 versus 6 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Five patients died before the interview , all of them had taken appetite suppressants .
In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain , 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants .
The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill , and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis .
A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension .
Intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease .
