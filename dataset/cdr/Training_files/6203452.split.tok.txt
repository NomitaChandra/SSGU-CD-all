Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy .
Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy ( characterized by renal insufficiency , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , and usually thrombocytopenia ) after treatment with cisplatin , bleomycin , and a vinca alkaloid .
One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , three the hemolytic - uremic syndrome , and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders .
Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation , primarily affecting the small arteries , arterioles , and glomeruli .
Because each patient was tumor - free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome , the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy .
Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined , because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug - induced bone marrow suppression .
