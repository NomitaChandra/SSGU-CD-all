Propylthiouracil - induced perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody - positive vasculitis in conjunction with pericarditis .
OBJECTIVE : To describe a case of propylthiouracil - induced vasculitis manifesting with pericarditis .
METHODS : We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis , fever , and glomerulonephritis developed .
Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done , and a pericardial biopsy was performed .
RESULTS : A 25 - year - old woman with Graves ' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis , which was confirmed by biopsy .
Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( pANCA ) against myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) .
Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn , and she was treated with a 1 - month course of prednisone , which alleviated her symptoms .
A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti - MPO pANCA - positive vasculitis associated with propylthio - uracil therapy .
CONCLUSION : Pericarditis may be the initial manifestation of drug - induced vasculitis attributable to propylthio - uracil therapy .
