Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation .
Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare .
Therefore , when the arrhythmia is present in this population , reversible causes must be identified and resolved .
Thyroid disorders , illicit drug or stimulant use , and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes .
We report the case of a 30 - year - old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
His medical history was unremarkable , except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot .
Thyroid - stimulating hormone , magnesium , and potassium levels were within normal limits , urine drug screen was negative , and alcohol use was denied .
However , when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements , the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed .
The patient was admitted to the hospital , anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin , and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control .
When discharged less than 24 hours later , he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin , with follow - up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion .
Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance .
Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat , fish , and other animal products .
Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia .
Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements .
In addition , it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature .
