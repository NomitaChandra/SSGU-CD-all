Safety and side - effects of alprazolam .
Controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder .
BACKGROUND : The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects .
The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia , and the side - effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured .
METHOD : In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM - III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo .
Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation .
Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16 .
RESULTS : Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily .
Compared with placebo subjects , alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions ( 21 % v .
0 % ) of depression , enuresis , disinhibition and aggression ; and more side - effects , particularly sedation , irritability , impaired memory , weight loss and ataxia .
Side - effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8 .
Despite this , the drop - out rate was low .
CONCLUSIONS : Alprazolam caused side - effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these .
