Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever .
Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever ( AHF ) of more than 8 days of evolution .
Administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon titers .
The average time of death was delayed .
A reversible anemia was the only adverse effect observed .
From these results , we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of AHF , and that anemia , the only secondary reaction observed , can be easily managed .
The possible beneficial effect of ribavirin during the initial days of AHF is discussed .
