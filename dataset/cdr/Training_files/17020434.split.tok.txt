Optimising stroke prevention in non - valvular atrial fibrillation .
Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality .
Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62 % , and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22 % .
Overall , in high - risk patients , warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes , with a relative risk reduction of 36 % .
Ximelagatran , an oral direct thrombin inhibitor , was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events , but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests .
The ACTIVE - W ( Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events ) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy ( clopidogrel plus aspirin ) in the prevention af embolic events .
Idraparinux , a Factor Xa inhibitor , is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor - blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling .
Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion .
Finally , percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high - risk patients .
