The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients ( ASA groups 3 and 4 ) .
The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients .
We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response .
The haemodynamic effects of adding 15 , 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3 / 4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito - urinary surgery .
The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study .
However , marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients , occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients .
Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia , we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine / propofol / mixtures studied .
