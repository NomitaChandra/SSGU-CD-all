Thyroxine abuse: an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.
Eating disorders and the associated behavioural problems and drug abuse are uncommon in pregnancy.
When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus.
This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with eating disorders in pregnancy, including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse.
In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with eating disorders and reminds us that when a cause for thyrotoxicosis remains obscure, thyroxine abuse should be considered and explored.
