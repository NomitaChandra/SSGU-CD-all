Further observations on the electrophysiologic effects of oral amiodarone therapy.
A case is presented of a reversible intra-Hisian block occurring under amiodarone treatment for atrial tachycardia in a patient without clear intraventricular conduction abnormalities.
His bundle recordings showed an atrial tachycardia with intermittent exit block and greatly prolonged BH and HV intervals (40 and 100 msec, respectively).
Thirty days after amiodarone discontinuation, His bundle electrograms showed atrial flutter without intra-Hisian or infra-Hisian delay.
Amiodarone should be used with caution during long-term oral therapy in patients with or without clear intraventricular conduction defects.
