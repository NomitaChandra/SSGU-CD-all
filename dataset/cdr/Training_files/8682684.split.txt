Acetaminophen-induced hypotension.
Through 30 years of widespread use, acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages.
The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low.
However, acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis, including hypotension, in sensitive individuals.
This article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen.
Other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detectable.
The hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration.
The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin.
