Activation of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin - induced heart failure .
Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress .
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( DOX ) , a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic .
Thus , we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .
Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34 , we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX .
PARP - 1 + / + and PARP - 1 - / - mice received a single injection of DOX ( 25 mg / kg i . p ) .
Five days after DOX administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP - 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in PARP - 1 - / - ones .
Similar experiments were conducted in BALB / c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle .
Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals .
In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX - induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart .
Thus , PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX .
PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the DOX treatment .
