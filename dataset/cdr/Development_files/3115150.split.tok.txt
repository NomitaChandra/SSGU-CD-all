Ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil - induced muscle rigidity .
Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin , a relatively specific type - 2 serotonin receptor antagonist , significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short - acting opiate agonist alfentanil .
Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal 's left gastrocnemius muscle , rigidity was assessed by analyzing root - mean - square electromyographic activity .
Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0 . 63 and 2 . 5 mg / kg prevented the alfentanil - induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline .
Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg / kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil .
Despite the absence of rigidity , animals that received ketanserin ( greater than 0 . 31 mg / kg i . p . ) followed by alfentanil were motionless , flaccid , and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone .
Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60 - min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone .
These results , in combination with previous work , suggest that muscle rigidity , a clinically relevant side - effect of parenteral narcotic administration , may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways .
Pretreatment with type - 2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate - induced rigidity , although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS , cardiovascular , and respiratory depression .
