Fatal excited delirium following cocaine use : epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of cocaine toxicity .
We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine - induced excited delirium ( EDDs ) in Dade County , Florida between 1979 and 1990 .
From a registry of all cocaine - related deaths in Dade County , Florida , from 1969 - 1990 , 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental cocaine overdose without excited delirium .
Compared with controls , EDDs were more frequently black , male , and younger .
They were less likely to have a low body mass index , and more likely to have died in police custody , to have received medical treatment immediately before death , to have survived for a longer period , to have developed hyperthermia , and to have died in summer months .
EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls .
The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and , when coupled with recent cocaine use , may precipitate agitation , delirium , aberrant thermoregulation , rhabdomyolysis , and sudden death .
