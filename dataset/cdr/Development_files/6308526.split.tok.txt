Naloxazone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory , temperature , and behavioral effects of morphine .
Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone , an antagonist of high - affinity mu 1 opioid receptors .
Pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia , catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high - affinity binding in brain membranes .
Moreover , naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine - induced hypotension and respiratory depression , whereas morphine - induced bradycardia was less affected .
Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine .
