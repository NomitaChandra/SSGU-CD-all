Renal papillary necrosis due to naproxen .
A 31 - year - old man with rheumatoid arthritis , who had previously been treated with sulindac , fenoprofen calcium , high dose salicylates and gold salts , developed renal papillary necrosis ( RPN ) 4 months after institution of naproxen therapy .
No other factor predisposing to RPN could be discovered .
Sulindac was substituted for naproxen and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months .
We review previous reports linking RPN to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of sulindac in patients who have experienced renal toxicity from other antiinflammatory agents .
