Severe immune hemolytic anemia associated with prophylactic use of cefotetan in obstetric and gynecologic procedures.
Second- and third-generation cephalosporins, especially cefotetan, are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune hemolytic anemia.
We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of cefotetan-induced hemolytic anemias were in patients who had received cefotetan prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures.
Eight of these cases of severe immune hemolytic anemia are described.
