Stroke and cocaine or amphetamine use .
The association of cocaine and amphetamine use with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is based almost solely on data from case series .
The limited number of epidemiologic studies of stroke and use of cocaine and / or amphetamine have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and / or minorities .
This case - control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California .
We attempted to identify all incident strokes in women ages 15 - 44 years during a 3 - year period using hospital admission and discharge records , emergency department logs , and payment requests for out - of - plan hospitalizations .
We selected controls , matched on age and facility of usual care , at random from healthy members of the health plan .
We obtained information in face - to - face interviews .
There were 347 confirmed stroke cases and 1 , 021 controls .
The univariate matched odds ratio for stroke in women who admitted to using cocaine and / or amphetamine was 8 . 5 ( 95 % confidence interval = 3 . 6 - 20 . 0 ) .
After further adjustment for potential confounders , the odds ratio in women who reported using cocaine and / or amphetamine was 7 . 0 ( 95 % confidence interval = 2 . 8 - 17 . 9 ) .
The use of cocaine and / or amphetamine is a strong risk factor for stroke in this socioeconomically heterogeneous , insured urban population .
