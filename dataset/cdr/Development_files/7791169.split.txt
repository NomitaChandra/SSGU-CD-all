Protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin.
METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B).
Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days).
Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B.
BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05).
Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05).
The mean increments in BUN, creatinine, and K were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A.
Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction.
Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control.
