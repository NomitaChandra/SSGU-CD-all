Amisulpride related tic - like symptoms in an adolescent schizophrenic .
Tic disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone , olanzapine and ziprasidone .
However , there are two case reports that show tic - like symptoms , including motor and phonic variants , occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine .
We present a 15 - year - old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye - blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment ( 1000 mg per day ) .
The tic - like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day .
However , her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction .
We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine .
She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function .
No more tic - like symptoms or other side effects have been reported .
Together with previously reported cases , our patient suggests that tic - like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine , clozapine , or amisulpride .
