Cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with L - dopa - induced peak - dose dyskinesia .
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) changes induced by the execution of a finger - to - thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L - dopa medication , the first one without L - dopa induced dyskinesia ( n = 23 ) and the other with moderate peak - dose dyskinesia ( n = 15 ) , and of a group of 14 normal subjects .
Single photon emission tomography with i . v .
133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes .
The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non - dyskinetic parkinsonian patients , with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi - and contralateral primary motor areas .
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement , like L - dopa - induced peak dose dyskinesia , is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop .
