Cefotetan - induced immune hemolytic anemia .
Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug - adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first - generation cephalosporins .
We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan .
Cefotetan - dependent antibodies were detected in the patient 's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells .
The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan , suggesting the concomitant formation of warm - reactive autoantibodies .
These observations , in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis , are consistent with drug - induced hemolytic anemia , possibly involving both drug - adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms .
This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins .
