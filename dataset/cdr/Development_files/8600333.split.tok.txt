Late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor .
Cardiac function was assessed in long - term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen 's T5 or T10 protocol , both including doxorubicin .
Thirty - one patients , age 10 - 45 years ( median age 17 . 8 years ) were evaluated 2 . 3 - 14 . 1 years ( median 8 . 9 years ) following completion of treatment .
Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225 - 550 mg / m2 ( median dose 360 ) .
The evaluation consisted of a history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , signal averaged ECG , 24 - hour ambulatory ECG , echocardiography and radionuclide angiography .
Eighteen of 31 ( 58 % ) patients showed cardiac toxicity , defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities : late potentials , complex ventricular arrhythmias , left ventricular dilation , decreased shortening fraction , or decreased ejection fraction .
The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow - up ( P < or = . 05 ) .
No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status , except for heart rate variability .
When adjusted to body surface area , the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW index ) was decreased in all patients .
The incidence of doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow - up , irrespective of cumulative dose .
Life - long cardiac follow - up in these patients is warranted .
The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity .
