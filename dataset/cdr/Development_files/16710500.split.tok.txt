Ethambutol - associated optic neuropathy .
INTRODUCTION : Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis , which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia , and can be associated with permanent visual loss .
We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia .
CLINICAL PICTURE : Three patients with ethambutol - associated toxic optic neuropathy are described .
All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity , colour vision ( Ishihara ) and visual field .
The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour , suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm .
TREATMENT : Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis , visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months .
Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases .
In the third case , visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale .
OUTCOME : All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function .
CONCLUSIONS : Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up .
The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy , ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm .
