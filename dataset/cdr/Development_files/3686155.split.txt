Postpartum psychosis induced by bromocriptine.
Two multigravida patients with no prior psychiatric history were seen with postpartum psychosis, having received bromocriptine for inhibition of lactation.
Bromocriptine given in high doses has been associated with psychosis in patients receiving the drug for Parkinson's disease.
These cases demonstrate that bromocriptine may cause psychosis even when given in low doses.
