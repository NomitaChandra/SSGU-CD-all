Photodistributed nifedipine - induced facial telangiectasia .
Five months after starting nifedipine ( Adalat ) , two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia , which became more noticeable with time .
Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or flushing .
Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug .
One commenced the closely related drug amlodipine 3 years later , with recurrence of telangiectasia .
The photodistribution of the telangiectasia suggests a significant drug / light interaction .
