Effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced convulsions in rats .
To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins ( PGs ) to seizure induction , the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl , picrotoxin , pentetrazol ( PTZ ) , electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated .
Ibuprofen , sulindac , mefenamic acid , and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency - to - onset in the flurothyl and / or PTZ models ; the electroshock , picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents .
These results suggest that PGs are involved in the mechanism ( s ) underlying fluorthyl - and PTZ - induced convulsions , but not picrotoxin - , electroshock - , or bicuculline - induced convulsions .
