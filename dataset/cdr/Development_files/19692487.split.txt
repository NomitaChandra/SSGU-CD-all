Mice lacking mPGES-1 are resistant to lithium-induced polyuria.
Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium-induced polyuria.
However, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (PG) isomerase has not been evaluated.
The present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1).
A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine.
This was associated with elevated renal mPGES-1 protein expression and increased urine PGE(2) excretion.
In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output.
Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +/+ mice.
This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice.
qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex.
Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment.
In contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice.
We conclude that mPGES-1-derived PGE(2) mediates lithium-induced polyuria likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NKCC2 expression.
