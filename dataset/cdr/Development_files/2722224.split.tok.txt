Hydrocortisone - induced hypertension in humans : pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function .
Oral hydrocortisone increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects .
We studied the effects of 1 week of oral hydrocortisone ( 200 mg / day ) on blood pressure , cardiac output , total peripheral resistance , forearm vascular resistance , and norepinephrine spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers .
Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged , systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg ( SED + / - 3 . 4 , p less than 0 . 01 ) , associated with an increased cardiac output ( 5 . 85 - 7 . 73 l / min , SED + / - 0 . 46 , p less than 0 . 01 ) .
Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15 . 1 to 12 . 2 mm Hg / l / min ( SED + / - 1 . 03 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged , but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated , the rise in resistance increasing from 10 . 5 mm Hg / ml / 100 ml / min ( R units ) before treatment to 32 . 6 R units after treatment ( SED + / - 6 . 4 , p less than 0 . 025 ) .
The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra - arterial norepinephrine ( 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / min ) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone , increasing from an average of 14 . 9 + / - 2 . 4 R units before treatment to 35 . 1 + / - 5 . 5 R units after hydrocortisone ( SED + / - 6 . 0 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
A shift to the left in the dose - response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment .
Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased .
The rise in resting blood pressure with hydrocortisone is associated with an increased cardiac output ( presumably due to increased blood volume ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) .
