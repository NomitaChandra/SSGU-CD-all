Comparison of developmental toxicology of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) in rats using selected dosing paradigms .
BACKGROUND : Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis .
Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) , an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor , induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD ) 9 , 10 , or 11 ( Kimmel CA , Wilson JG , Schumacher HJ .
Teratology 4 : 15 - 24 , 1971 ) .
There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17 .
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9 , 10 , or 11 ; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats ; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used .
METHODS : ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0 , 250 , 500 , or 625 mg / kg ) , 10 ( 0 , 500 , 625 , or 750 mg / kg ) , or 11 ( 0 , 500 , 750 , or 1000 mg / kg ) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0 , 50 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg a day ) in the multiple dose study to SD rats .
Animals were killed on GD 21 , and fetuses were examined viscerally .
RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects ( VSDs ) and midline defects ( MDs ) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia ( DH ) , MDs , and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these malformations , even though ASA induces several other low - incidence malformations .
In single dose studies , DH , MD , and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10 .
VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11 .
In contrast , DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and VSD was noted across all dose groups .
CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats .
Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) .
It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , malformations that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses .
