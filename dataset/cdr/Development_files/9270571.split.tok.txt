Potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist , A - 86929 : an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa - primed monkeys .
The clinical utility of dopamine ( DA ) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is still unclear .
The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF - 82958 ( 6 - chloro - 7 , 8 - dihydroxy - 3 - allyl - 1 - phenyl - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrahydro - 1H - 3 - benzaze pine hydrobromide ) and A - 77636 ( [ 1R , 3S ] 3 - [ 1 ' - admantyl ] - 1 - aminomethyl - 3 , 4 - dihydro - 5 , 6 - dihydroxy - 1H - 2 - benzo pyran hydrochloride ) seems limited because of their duration of action , which is too short for SKF - 82958 ( < 1 hr ) and too long for A - 77636 ( > 20 hr , leading to behavioral tolerance ) .
We therefore conducted the present acute dose - response study in four 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) - exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa - induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses ( from 0 . 03 to 1 . 0 mg / kg ) of A - 86929 ( [ - ] - [ 5aR , 11bS ] - 4 , 5 , 5a , 6 , 7 , 11b - hexahydro - 2 - propyl - 3 - thia - 5 - + + + azacyclopent - 1 - ena [ c ] phenathrene - 9 - 10 - diol ) , a selective and full DA D1 - like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action .
Levodopa and the DA D2 - like receptor agonist , LY - 171555 ( [ 4aR - trans ] - 4 , 4a , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 8a , 9 - o - dihydro - 5n - propyl - 2H - pyrazo lo - 3 - 4 - quinoline hydrochloride ) were also used for comparison .
Acute administration of A - 86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP - induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY - 171555 , but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa - induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY - 171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa .
Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus ( referred to as the basal ganglia output ) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist .
Potent DA D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as A - 86929 ( approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested ) are potential therapeutic tools in PD and merit further attention .
