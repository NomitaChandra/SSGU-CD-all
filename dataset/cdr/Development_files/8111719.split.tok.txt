Hallucinations and ifosfamide - induced neurotoxicity .
BACKGROUND : Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide .
Most cases of ifosfamide - induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes .
METHODS : The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide - induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium .
All patients were receiving high - dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure .
RESULTS : Hallucinations occurred only when the patient 's eyes were closed and , in all but one case , were reported as disturbing or frightening .
Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely .
CONCLUSIONS : Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity .
The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related .
The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide - induced hallucinations , which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity .
" Eyes - closed " hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation .
Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence .
Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear .
If agitation becomes marked , high - potency neuroleptics ( i . e . , haloperidol ) may be effective .
