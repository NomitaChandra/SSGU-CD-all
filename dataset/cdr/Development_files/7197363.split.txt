REM sleep deprivation changes behavioral response to catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation in rats.
The effects of REM sleep deprivation (REMD) on apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and quipazine-induced head twitches in rats were determined.
Forty-eight hr of REMD increased apomorphine-induced aggressiveness, and reduced (immediately after completing of REMD) or increased (96 hr after completing of REMD) quipazine-induced head twitches.
Results are discussed in terms of similarity to pharmacological effects of other antidepressive treatments.
