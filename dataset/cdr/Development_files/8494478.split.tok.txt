Ciprofloxacin - induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer .
Nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is uncommon .
Five patients with cancer who developed acute renal failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed .
Other than elevation of serum creatinine levels , characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present .
Allergic interstitial nephritis is believed to be the underlying pathological - process .
Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy , although this is not always feasible .
An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of ciprofloxacin - induced acute renal failure .
