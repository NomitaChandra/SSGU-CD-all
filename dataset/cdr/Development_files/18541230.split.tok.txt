Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats .
We investigated the effects of antithrombin , a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors , in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrosis , which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome .
Antithrombin ( 50 or 500 IU / kg / i . v . ) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside ( 50 mg / kg / i . v . ) .
Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside - induced hematological abnormalities .
Puromycin aminonucleoside - induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed .
Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats , while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin - treated rats .
In addition , antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside - induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells .
Furthermore , puromycin aminonucleoside - induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased .
These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome .
Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome .
