Carbamazepine - induced cardiac dysfunction .
Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes .
A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block , induced by carbamazepine , prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases .
From the analysis of these cases , two distinct forms of carbamazepine - associated cardiac dysfunction emerged .
One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose .
The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life - threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay , associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels .
Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions , the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients .
