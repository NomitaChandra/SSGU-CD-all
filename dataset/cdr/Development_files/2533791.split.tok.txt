National project on the prevention of mother - to - infant infection by hepatitis B virus in Japan .
In Japan , a nationwide prevention program against mother - to - infant infection by hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) started in 1985 .
This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) and hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) positive mothers .
These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIG ) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine .
We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987 .
93 . 4 % pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg , and the positive rate was 1 . 4 to 1 . 5 % .
The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26 % .
The HBsAg positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3 % and 2 % respectively .
Some problems may arise , because 27 to 30 % of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas .
