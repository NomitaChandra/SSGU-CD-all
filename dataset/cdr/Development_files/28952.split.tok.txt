Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension : the influence of dietary sodium restriction .
To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment .
Chlorthalidone ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 days .
Six patients received a normal - sodium diet and four a low - sodium ( 17 mmol / day ) diet .
All patients had a normal initial total body potassium ( 40K ) .
The electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone secretion rate were measured .
In both groups a potassium deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment .
In the normal - sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some potassium was regained ; in the low - sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13 .
The normal - sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels ; in the low - sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated .
It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic - induced potassium loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion .
