Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506 : inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ; 50 mg / kg ) and Fujimycine ( FK506 ; 5 mg / kg ) , but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin ( 5 mg / kg ) , caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate , degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium , and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days .
The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated .
Cyclophilin A and FK506 - binding protein , the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506 , respectively , were each detected in renal tissue extract .
In the kidney , high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506 , but not by rapamycin .
Finally , specific immunophilin - drug - calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506 , but not rapamycin .
These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase .
