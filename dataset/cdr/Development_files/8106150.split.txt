Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L-dopa-induced dyskinesias in MPTP-treated monkeys.
A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP.
They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months.
This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia.
A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified.
Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology.
However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements.
Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia.
Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea.
