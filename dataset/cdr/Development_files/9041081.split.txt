Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve.
PURPOSE: To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on the retina and optic nerve.
SETTING: Eye Clinic, S. Salvatore Hospital, L'Aquila University, Italy.
METHODS: Standard pattern electroretinograms (P-ERGs) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials (P-VEPs) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5.00 and 15.00 diopters (D) (mean 8.00 D).
Testing was done preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively.
The contralateral eyes served as controls.
During the follow-up, 3 patients (12%) developed steroid-induced elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) that resolved after corticosteroid therapy was discontinued.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment.
The transient steroid-induced IOP rise did not seem to cause functional impairment.
