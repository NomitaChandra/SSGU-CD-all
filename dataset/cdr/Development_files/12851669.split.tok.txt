Absolute and attributable risk of venous thromboembolism in women on combined cyproterone acetate and ethinylestradiol .
OBJECTIVE : To achieve absolute risk estimates of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) among women on cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol ( CPA / EE ) , and among women on combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) .
METHODS : From the Danish National Register of Patients ( NRP ) , 1996 to 1998 , the records of 1 . 1 million Danish women , ages 15 to 44 years , were searched for evidence of VTE .
COC use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires .
Sales statistics of COCs and CPA / EE were provided through Danish Drug Statistics .
RESULTS : During the time frame of the study , 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs .
Of these women , 67 were on levonorgestrel - containing COCs .
Eleven were on CPA / EE .
The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3 . 4 ( range , 3 . 1 - 3 . 8 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on COCs , 4 . 2 ( range , 3 . 2 - 5 . 2 ) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel - containing COCs , and 3 . 1 ( range , 1 . 3 - 4 . 9 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA / EE .
CONCLUSION : Our results suggest the absolute risk of VTE among Danish women on COCs is similar to that among women taking CPA / EE .
