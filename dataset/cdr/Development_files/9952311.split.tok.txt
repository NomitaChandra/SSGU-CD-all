Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin - induced cardiomyopathy in mice : suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression .
The use of adriamycin ( ADR ) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity .
Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR 's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i . p .
treated with ADR for several weeks .
At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy .
In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes .
Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies .
Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment .
Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined , only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver .
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment .
