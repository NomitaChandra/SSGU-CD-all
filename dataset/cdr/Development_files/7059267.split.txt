Chlorpropamide-induced optic neuropathy.
A 65-year-old woman with adult-onset diabetes treated with chlorpropamide (Diabenese) had a toxic optic neuropathy that resolved with discontinuation of chlorpropamide therapy.
Visual loss occurs in diabetics for a variety of reasons, and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy.
The possibility of a drug-induced optic neuropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of visual loss in diabetics.
