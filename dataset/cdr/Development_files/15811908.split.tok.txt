Pheochromocytoma unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride .
OBJECTIVE : To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride .
CASE SUMMARY : A 42 - year - old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg .
Both drugs were immediately discontinued , and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment .
Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass , and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma .
DISCUSSION : Drug - induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs , but the underlying mechanism is unknown .
In our case , use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy .
CONCLUSIONS : As of March 24 , 2005 , this is the first reported case of amisulpride - and tiapride - induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma .
Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and amisulpride .
