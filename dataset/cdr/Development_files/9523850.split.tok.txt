Value of methylprednisolone in prevention of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of iron dextran : a double blind randomized trial .
The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion ( TDI ) of iron dextran has been well documented .
In 40 % of treated patients , an arthralgia - myalgia syndrome develops .
The purpose of this randomized , double - blind , prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous ( i . v . ) administration of methylprednisolone ( MP ) prevents this complication .
Sixty - five patients , 34 women and 31 men , ages 36 to 80 years , received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1 ) , 125 mg i . v .
MP before and saline after TDI ( group 2 ) , or 125 mg i . v .
MP before and after TDI ( group 3 ) .
Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity .
Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients , 33 % of group 2 , and 26 % of group 3 had reactions to TDI .
The severity of reactions ( minimal , mild , and moderate , respectively ) was as follows : group 1 - - 6 , 6 , and 2 ; group 2 - - 1 , 5 , and 0 ; group 3 - - 5 , 1 , and 0 .
Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher 's exact test using 95 % confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf .
These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia - myalgia syndrome .
We conclude that 125 mg i . v .
MP should be given routinely before and after TDI of iron dextran .
