Protective effect of a specific platelet - activating factor antagonist , BN 52021 , on bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular impairments in rats .
Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine ( 1 . 5 or 2 mg / kg , i . v . ) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure ( MBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) leading to death ( in 67 % or 90 % of animals respectively ) .
Intravenous injection of the specific platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) antagonist BN 52021 ( 10 mg / kg ) , 30 min before bupivacaine administration ( 2 mg / kg i . v . ) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR .
In contrast , doses of 1 mg / kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg / kg administered 5 min before i . v .
injection of bupivacaine were ineffective .
When BN 52021 ( 20 mg / kg i . v . ) was injected immediately after bupivacaine ( 2 mg / kg ) , a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg / kg was ineffective .
A partial recovery of bupivacaine - induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021 .
Since the administration of BN 52021 , at all doses studied , did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used , the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021 , a specific antagonist of PAF , against bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular toxicity .
Thus , consistent with its direct effect on heart , PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular alterations .
