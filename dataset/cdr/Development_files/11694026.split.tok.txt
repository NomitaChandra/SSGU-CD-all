Tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients with NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nimesulide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous , respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well - documented history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
Furthermore , we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide .
A single - placebo - controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema .
A total of 75 / 829 ( 9 . 4 % ) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol .
Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 ( 8 . 6 % ) showed a positive test , while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol , 13 ( 9 . 6 % ) did not tolerate this drug .
Furthermore , 18 . 28 % of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11 . 8 % of subjects with an history of NSAID - induced urticaria / angioedema or angioedema alone ( with or without chronic urticaria ) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs .
Taken together , our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria / angioedema caused by NSAIDs .
However , the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and , above all , by a history of NSAID - induced angioedema .
