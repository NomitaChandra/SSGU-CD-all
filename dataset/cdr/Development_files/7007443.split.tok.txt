Circulating lysosomal enzymes and acute hepatic necrosis .
The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , N - acetylglucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure .
Acid protease ( cathepsin D ) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose , whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived .
A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase , which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall .
Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs , and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition .
