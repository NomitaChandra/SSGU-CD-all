Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate - induced narcosis in rats .
Melatonin affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced narcosis .
Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with melatonin ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 and 50 mg / kg ) .
Melatonin pre - treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis , however , no dose - effect correlation was found .
In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis .
In contrast , the highest dose of melatonin ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis , and a reduction in mortality rate .
Melatonin 0 . 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine - or diazepam - induced narcosis .
Thus , the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action .
