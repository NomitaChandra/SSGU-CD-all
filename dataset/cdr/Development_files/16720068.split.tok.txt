Possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to concomitant treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam .
A 74 - year - old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia , loss of appetite , exhaustion , and agitation .
Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1 . 2 mg alprazolam .
On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment , the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation , disorientation , and severe muscle rigidity with tremors .
The patient had a fever ( 38 . 2 degrees C ) , fluctuating blood pressure ( between 165 / 90 and 130 / 70 mg mm Hg ) , and severe extrapyramidal symptoms .
Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase ( 2218 IU / L ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( 134 IU / L ) , alanine aminotransferase ( 78 IU / L ) , and BUN ( 27 . 9 mg / ml ) levels .
The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms .
7 days later , the fever disappeared and the patient 's serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L ) .
This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) , thus demonstrating that NMS - like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment .
The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case , indicating a probable relationship between the patient 's NMS - like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case .
The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected .
Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration , agitation , malnutrition , and exhaustion .
Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression .
