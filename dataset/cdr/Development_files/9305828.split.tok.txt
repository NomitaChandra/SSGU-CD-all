Neuropeptide - Y immunoreactivity in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
Neuropeptide - Y ( NPY ) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) .
This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices .
The pilocarpine ( PILO ) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage .
We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model .
PILO - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases , within presumed granule cells .
NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas .
In addition , PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls .
The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the PILO model of TLE .
However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .
