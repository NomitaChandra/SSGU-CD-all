Prolongation of the QT interval related to cisapride - diltiazem interaction .
Cisapride , a cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) substrate , is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders .
Prolongation of QT interval , torsades de pointes , and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents , but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors .
A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45 - year - old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem , an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 , for hypertension .
The patient was in near syncope and had QT - interval prolongation .
After discontinuing cisapride , the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur .
We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , including diltiazem .
