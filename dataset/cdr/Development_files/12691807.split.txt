Levodopa-induced oromandibular dystonia in progressive supranuclear palsy.
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias have been reported in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.
Cranial dystonias are rare in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible levodopa-induced Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) in a PSP patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of PSP, and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology.
