Nature , time course and dose dependence of zidovudine - related side effects : results from the Multicenter Canadian Azidothymidine Trial .
To characterize the nature , time course and dose dependency of zidovudine - related side effects , we undertook a multicenter , prospective , dose - range finding study .
Our study group consisted of 74 HIV - positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B , III and IV C2 from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) classification of HIV disease .
Following a 3 - week observation period , volunteers were treated with zidovudine 600 mg / day for 18 weeks , 900 mg / day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg / day for 9 weeks , followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re - started on 1200 mg / day or the highest tolerated dose at 8 - hourly intervals .
Subjects were randomly assigned to 4 - hourly or 8 - hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg / day .
Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3 - week intervals .
Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96 % of subjects , most commonly nausea ( 64 % ) , fatigue ( 55 % ) and headache ( 49 % ) .
These were generally self - limited , reappearing briefly at each dose increment .
A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy .
This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment .
A red blood cell count decrease , a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose - independent fashion , reverting at least partially during the washout phase .
The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg / day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg / day .
Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by megaloblastosis in 95 % of 65 specimens at week 18 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) .
