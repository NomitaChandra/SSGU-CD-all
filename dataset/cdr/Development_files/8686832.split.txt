Leg and back pain after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
Fifty-four patients, aged 27-90 years, who were given lignocaine 5% in 6.8% glucose solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied.
Thirteen of these patients experienced pain in the legs and/or back after recovery from anaesthesia.
The patients affected were younger (p < 0.05) and the site of the dural puncture was higher (p < 0.01) than those individuals without pain.
Five of the 13 patients (38%) with pain and seven of the 41 patients (17%) without pain admitted to a high alcohol intake, which might be a contributing factor.
Leg and/or back pain is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
