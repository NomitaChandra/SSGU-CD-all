The activation of spinal N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia .
We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats .
Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter .
In a microdialysis study , 10 muL of saline ( group C ; n = 8 ) or 30 mug of morphine ( group M ; n = 8 ) was injected intrathecally ( IT ) 0 . 5 h after reflow , and 30 mug of morphine ( group SM ; n = 8 ) or 10 muL of saline ( group SC ; n = 8 ) was injected IT 0 . 5 h after sham operation .
Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia , before IT injection , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , and 48 h of reperfusion ( after IT injection ) .
Second , we investigated the effect of IT MK - 801 ( 30 mug ) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis .
After IT morphine , the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
This increase persisted for 8 hrs .
IT MK - 801 significantly reduced the number of dark - stained alpha - motoneurons after morphine - induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group .
These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate , which is involved in NMDA receptor activation .
We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation .
