Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced idiopathic Parkinson 's disease .
A prospective , randomized , double - blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) refractory to medical treatment was designed .
Ten consecutive patients ( mean age , 58 . 4 + / - 6 . 8 years ; 7 men , 3 women ) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease ( mean disease time , 8 . 4 + / - 3 . 5 years ) , disabling motor fluctuations ( Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3 - 5 in off - drug phases ) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias were selected .
All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed .
Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna ( GPi ) and four in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) .
Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living ( ADL ) score in ' on ' - and ' off ' - drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery .
There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months .
Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group .
Changes in UPDRS , Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups .
Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups .
Complications were observed in two patients : one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg / day .
The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment .
