Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine .
Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery .
Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action .
This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase .
Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine - induced tachycardia , while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta - blocking agent into the SA node artery .
This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery .
