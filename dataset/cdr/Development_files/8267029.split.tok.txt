Penicillamine - induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis .
A 67 - year - old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ( RPGN ) after 5 months of D - penicillamine ( 250 mg / day ) treatment .
Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60 % of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole .
Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG , IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium .
The patient was treated with steroid pulse , plasmapheresis , cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents .
A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks .
This new case of RPGN in the course of D - penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients .
The prompt discontinuation of D - penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case .
