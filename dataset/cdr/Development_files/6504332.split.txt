Phenobarbital-induced dyskinesia in a neurologically-impaired child.
A 2-year-old child with known neurologic impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seizures.
Known causes of movement disorders were eliminated after evaluation.
On repeat challenge with phenobarbital, the dyskinesia recurred.
