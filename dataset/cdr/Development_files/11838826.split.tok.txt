Treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist in children .
BACKGROUND : Risperidone , a potent antagonist of both serotonergic ( 5HT2A ) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children .
Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature .
These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth .
We report the successful treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth .
METHODS : We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline .
RESULTS : Four males ( age 6 - 11 years ) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( fourth edition ) bipolar disorder or psychoses , with risperidone - induced elevations in serum prolactin levels ( 57 . 5 - 129 ng / mL , normal 5 - 15 ng / mL ) , were treated with cabergoline ( mean dose 2 . 13 + / - 0 . 09 mg / week ) .
When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects ( mean 11 . 2 + / - 10 . 9 ng / mL ) , the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg / week in three of four subjects .
The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523 . 5 + / - 129 . 7 days , and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788 . 5 + / - 162 . 5 days .
Cabergoline was well tolerated without adverse effects .
CONCLUSIONS : Cabergoline may be useful for the treatment of risperidone - induced hyperprolactinemia in youth ; however , further research is needed .
