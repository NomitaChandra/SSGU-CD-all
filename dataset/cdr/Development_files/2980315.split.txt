Selective injection of iopentol, iohexol and metrizoate into the left coronary artery of the dog.
Induction of ventricular fibrillation and decrease of aortic pressure.
In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with iopentol, iohexol and metrizoate in doses of 4 ml, 8 ml and 16 ml.
Thirty-six iopentol injections, 35 iohexol injections and 37 metrizoate injections were made.
Frequencies of ventricular fibrillation were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after iopentol (0%) and iohexol (3%) than after metrizoate (22%).
Iopentol and iohexol also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than metrizoate at the different doses.
