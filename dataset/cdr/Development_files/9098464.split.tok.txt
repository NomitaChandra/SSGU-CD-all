A murine model of adenomyosis : the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine hydrochloride , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , on adenomyosis induction in Wistar albino rats .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis .
DESIGN : Fluoxetine , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor , was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia .
The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls .
Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days .
SETTING : Marmara University School of Medicine , Department of Histology and Embryology , Zeynep Kamil Women and Children 's Hospital .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serum prolactin levels , uterine histopathology .
RESULTS : The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups .
Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis , all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine .
CONCLUSION : It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma .
This invasion eventually progresses to adenomyosis .
