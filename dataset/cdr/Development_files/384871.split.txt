Bilateral optic neuropathy due to combined ethambutol and isoniazid treatment.
The case of a 40-year-old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with ethambutol and isoniazid is reported.
A bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic scotoma was found.
Ethambutol was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed.
Isoniazid was discontinued later, followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity.
The hazards of optic nerve toxicity due to ethambutol are known.
We emphasize the potential danger in the use of ethambutol and isoniazid.
