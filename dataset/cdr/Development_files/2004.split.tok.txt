Electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs .
Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life - threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs , either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants .
Although most patients were receiving several drugs , Mellaril ( thioridazine ) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia , one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman .
Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine ( chlorpromazine ) .
Aventyl ( nortriptyline ) and Elavil ( amitriptyline ) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman .
Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients .
The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock ; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one .
The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped .
Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger ; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease .
Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs .
A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs .
