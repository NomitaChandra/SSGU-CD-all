Pain responses in methadone - maintained opioid abusers .
Providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task , in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic requirements .
This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone - maintenance ( MM ) treatment ( n = 60 ) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) .
By using a placebo - controlled , two - way factorial design , tolerance to cold - pressor ( CP ) pain was examined , both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( hydromorphone 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( ketorolac 10 mg ) analgesic agents .
Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP pain than control subjects , replicating previous work .
Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group .
These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a pain - intolerant subset of clinical patients .
Their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively .
