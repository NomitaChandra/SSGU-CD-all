Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction: a case report.
BACKGROUND: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction.
It is considered safe, with minimal side effects.
Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC.
Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction (MI) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram.
CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain.
An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng/mL.
An initial exercise stress test was normal.
At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester.
It showed normal coronary vessels.
CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction.
Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC.
Given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.
