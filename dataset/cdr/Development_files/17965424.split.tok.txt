Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients : results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial ( EDGE - II ) .
OBJECTIVE : A randomised , double - blind study to compare the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerability , safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 4086 patients ( mean age 60 . 8 years ) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily ( n = 2032 ) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily ( n = 2054 ) .
Use of gastroprotective agents and low - dose aspirin was allowed .
The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences ( AEs ) .
General safety was also assessed , including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data .
Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status ( PGADS ; 0 - 4 point scale ) .
RESULTS : Mean ( SD ; maximum ) duration of treatment was 19 . 3 ( 10 . 3 ; 32 . 9 ) and 19 . 1 ( 10 . 4 ; 33 . 1 ) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups , respectively .
The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac ( 5 . 2 vs 8 . 5 events per 100 patient - years , respectively ; hazard ratio 0 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 , 0 . 81 ; p < or = 0 . 001 ) ) .
The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension - related and oedema - related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib ( 2 . 5 % and 1 . 1 % respectively ) compared with diclofenac ( 1 . 5 % and 0 . 4 % respectively ; p < 0 . 001 for hypertension and p < 0 . 01 for oedema ) .
Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy ( PGADS mean changes from baseline - 0 . 62 vs - 0 . 58 , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg .
Discontinuations from renovascular AEs , although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs , were significantly higher with etoricoxib .
