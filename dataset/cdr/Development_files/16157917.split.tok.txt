Lamotrigine associated with exacerbation or de novo myoclonus in idiopathic generalized epilepsies .
Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies ( IGE ) treated with lamotrigine ( LTG ) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic jerks ( MJ ) .
In three patients , LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose - dependent manner with early aggravation during titration .
MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50 % .
In two patients , LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner , with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal .
