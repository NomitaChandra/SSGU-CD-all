Cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates .
10 monkeys ( macaques ) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg / m2 ( 1 mg / kg ) .
8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose ( 310 mg / m2 ) well below that considered the safe upper limit ( 550 mg / m2 ) in man .
Histologically , the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline - induced cardiomyopathy .
1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg / m2 of adriamycin ; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug .
Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man , and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug .
