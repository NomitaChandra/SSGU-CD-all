Hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart .
The present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
The 47 - year - old female patient , known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation .
On transthoracic echocardiogram , she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation .
The recipient 's heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils .
Myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer .
It is likely that the hypersensitivity ( eosinophilic ) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy .
Eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2 . 4 % to 7 . 2 % in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy .
