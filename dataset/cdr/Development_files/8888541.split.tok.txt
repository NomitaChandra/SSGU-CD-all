Serotonin syndrome from venlafaxine - tranylcypromine interaction .
Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering , muscle rigidity , salivation , confusion , agitation and hyperthermia .
The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor .
Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine .
We report a venlafaxine - MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23 - y - old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression .
He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1 / 2 tab of venlafaxine .
Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities , tremors and rigidity .
He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering , myoclonic jerks , rigidity , salivation and diaphoresis .
His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light .
Vital signs were : blood pressure 120 / 67 mm Hg , heart rate 127 / min , respiratory rate 28 / min , and temperature 97 F .
After 180 mg of diazepam i . v .
he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws .
He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation , and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity .
His subsequent course was remarkable for non - immune thrombocytopenia which resolved .
The patient 's maximal temperature was 101 . 2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units / L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis .
His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward .
This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis .
