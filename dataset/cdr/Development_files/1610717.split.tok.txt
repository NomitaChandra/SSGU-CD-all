Cocaine - induced brainstem seizures and behavior .
A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine .
The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations .
Cocaine ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study .
Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects .
The abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , hyperactivity , hypersensitivity , " beating drum " behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing , and facial twitching .
Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states .
Hypersensitivity to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation .
These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation .
Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates .
Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .
