Pravastatin-associated myopathy.
Report of a case.
A case of acute inflammatory myopathy associated with the use of pravastatin, a new hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is reported.
The patient, a 69-year-old man was affected by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
He assumed pravastatin (20 mg/day) because of hypercholesterolemia.
He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation.
A previously unknown hypothyroidism, probably due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, was evidenced.
Muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4+ lymphocytes.
While lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with toxic myopathy, pravastatin-associated myopathy could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity.
