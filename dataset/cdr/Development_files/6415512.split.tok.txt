Myoclonic , atonic , and absence seizures following institution of carbamazepine therapy in children .
Five children , aged 3 to 11 years , treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy , had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic , atypical absence and / or atonic ( minor motor ) seizures within a few days .
When the carbamazepine was discontinued , two of the children returned to their former state very quickly , two had the minor motor seizures resolve in 3 and 6 months , and one had the seizures persist .
The child in whom the seizures persisted was later found to have ceroid lipofuscinosis .
The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants .
