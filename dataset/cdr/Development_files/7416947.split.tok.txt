Subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long - term administration of digoxin .
Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .
This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long - term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior , and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol , testosterone , and LH .
The patients of the study and control group ( without digoxin ) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age ( 25 - 40 years ) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients .
A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out , using parameters such as sexual desire , sexual excitement , and frequency of sexual relations .
Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior .
The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol , testosterone , and LH .
The differences in the means were significant .
Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire , sexual excitement phase ( erection ) , and frequency of sexual relations in the study group .
