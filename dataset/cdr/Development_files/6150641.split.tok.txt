Comparison of the effectiveness of ranitidine and cimetidine in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
The H2 - histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short - and long - term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states .
Nineteen patients had Zollinger - Ellison syndrome , one patient had systemic mastocytosis , and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion .
The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same .
The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents , and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion .
However , ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed ( 1 . 2 g per day for ranitidine and 3 . 6 g per day for cimetidine ) .
Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine .
Treatment with high doses of cimetidine ( one to 60 months ; median , 11 months ) or ranitidine ( two to 31 months ; median , 14 months ) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations , but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy .
The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
Both are safe at high doses , but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine .
