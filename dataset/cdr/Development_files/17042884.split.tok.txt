Placebo - level incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) with quetiapine in controlled studies of patients with bipolar mania .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) , including akathisia , with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania .
METHODS : Data were analyzed from four similarly designed , randomized , double - blind , 3 - to 12 - week studies .
Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy ( up to 800 mg / day ) ( n = 209 ) versus placebo ( n = 198 ) , with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls .
Two studies evaluated quetiapine ( up to 800 mg / day ) in combination with a mood stabilizer ( lithium or divalproex , QTP + Li / DVP ) ( n = 196 ) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer ( PBO + Li / DVP ) ( n = 203 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson - Angus Scale ( SAS ) , the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage .
RESULTS : The incidence of EPS - related adverse events , including akathisia , was no different with quetiapine monotherapy ( 12 . 9 % ) than with placebo ( 13 . 1 % ) .
Similarly , EPS - related adverse events with QTP + Li / DVP ( 21 . 4 % ) were no different than with PBO + Li / DVP ( 19 . 2 % ) .
Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59 . 6 % of patients treated with haloperidol ( n = 99 ) monotherapy , whereas 26 . 5 % of patients treated with lithium ( n = 98 ) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS .
The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy ( 3 . 3 % ) and placebo ( 6 . 1 % ) , and with QTP + Li / DVP ( 3 . 6 % ) and PBO + Li / DVP ( 4 . 9 % ) .
Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) of tremor ( 18 . 4 % ) than quetiapine ( 5 . 6 % ) ; cerebellar tremor , which is a known adverse effect of lithium , may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy .
Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 001 ) of akathisia ( 33 . 3 % versus 5 . 9 % ) , tremor ( 30 . 3 % versus 7 . 8 % ) , and extrapyramidal syndrome ( 35 . 4 % versus 5 . 9 % ) than quetiapine .
No significant differences were observed between quetiapine and placebo on SAS and BARS scores .
Anticholinergic use was low and similar with quetiapine or placebo .
CONCLUSIONS : In bipolar mania , the incidence of EPS , including akathisia , with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo .
