Methimazole - induced cholestatic jaundice .
Methimazole is a widely used and generally well - tolerated antithyroid agent .
A 43 - year - old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole ( 10 mg tid ) and propranolol ( 20 mg tid ) for treatment of hyperthyroidism .
The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications .
When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later , she still had severe icterus , pruritus , and hyperbilirubinemia , formed mainly of the conjugated fraction .
Methimazole - induced cholestasis was diagnosed , and propranolol therapy was resumed .
Over the following 9 days , the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole .
In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy , this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice .
Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that , upon occurrence , they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures .
