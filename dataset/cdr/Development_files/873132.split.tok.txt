Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha - hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol - induced cholestasis in rats .
Deoxycholic acid conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid , and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment .
During [ 24 - 14C ] sodium deoxycholate infusion , [ 14C ] biliary bile acid secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol - treated rats .
Ethinyl estradiol - treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7alpha - hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid .
Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid , but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1 . 5 % in controls to nearly 4 . 0 % ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species .
Furthermore , the rat converts deoxycholic acid , a poor choleretic , to taurocholic acid , a good choleretic .
When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid .
