Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha - benzene hexachloride .
Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha - benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically .
Although most of the hepatomas were well - differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes , the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes .
At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding , hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages .
A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes .
Within the nodules , foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared .
These cells proliferated further , replacing the most part of the nodules , and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed .
No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats .
