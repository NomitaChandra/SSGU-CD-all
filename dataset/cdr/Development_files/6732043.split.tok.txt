Induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration .
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54 - yr - old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens .
When the androgens were withdrawn , the patient 's physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal .
A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone .
Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea .
Our report provides direct evidence for this role .
Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep .
Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy .
