Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long - term phenobarbital therapy : an autopsy report of two patients .
Phenobarbital ( PB ) has a reputation for safety , and it is commonly believed that PB - related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease .
Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly : one as consequence of cardiac arrest , the other of acute bronchopneumonia .
At autopsy , analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate , which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells , associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non - specific granulomatous tissue .
Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen .
Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage , which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences .
For this reason , each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB - related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction .
