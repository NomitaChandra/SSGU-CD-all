Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine .
Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia .
All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen .
Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus .
In 3 patients a pre - existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously .
Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia / myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available , experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine , or its metabolites , plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome .
The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations .
