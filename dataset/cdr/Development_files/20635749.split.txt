Severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report.
This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF).
To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy.
Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment.
The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3).
Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.
This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients.
The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.
