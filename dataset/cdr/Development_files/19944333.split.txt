Sorafenib-induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm.
A 65-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest.
Two weeks before his admission, sorafenib had been started.
He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram.
Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction.
However, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography.
Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test.
Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib.
Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status.
We report the first case of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm.
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival.
On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm.
Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by sorafenib use.
