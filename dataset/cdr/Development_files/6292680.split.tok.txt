Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left - sided Wilms tumor .
Two children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of doxorubicin .
The cardiomyopathy is attributed 1 ) to the fact that radiation fields for left Wilms tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2 ) to the interaction of doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac muscle .
It is recommended that doxorubicin dosage be sharply restricted in children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation .
