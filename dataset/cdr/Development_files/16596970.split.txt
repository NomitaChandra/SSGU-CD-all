Pilocarpine seizures cause age-dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination.
Children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life-threatening and may cause life-long changes in brain and behavior.
The extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown.
A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20, or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45.
Pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous seizures.
Mature rats were trained with sound-source location and sound-silence discriminations.
Control (saline P20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately.
In status epilepticus (P20) rats, acquisition of the sound-source location discrimination was moderately impaired.
Status epilepticus (P45) rats failed to acquire either sound-source location or sound-silence discriminations.
Status epilepticus in rat causes an age-dependent, long-term impairment in auditory discrimination.
This impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.
