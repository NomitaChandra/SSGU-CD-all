Peripheral iron dextran induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra .
Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease .
To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( SN ) , in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry , tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry , Perls ' iron staining , and high performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals .
The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH - immunoreactive neurons in the SN .
As a result , dopamine release and content , as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen .
Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group .
These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN , where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons .
The chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload .
