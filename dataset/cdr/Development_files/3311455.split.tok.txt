Cardiac transplantation : improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol .
The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients .
In group I , cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17 . 5 mg / kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng / ml .
In group II , cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine , which was used for the first postoperative week .
Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels .
Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long - term therapy with cyclosporine .
Despite this improvement in late renal function , group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine .
We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect .
