Effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine-induced amnesia.
The effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase, scopolamine-induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and E-2020.
NIK-247, tacrine and E-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively).
In addition, NIK-247 and tacrine, but not E-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum.
All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity.
Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NIK-247 on AChE was reversible.
All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.
significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task.
The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.
did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats.
These findings suggest that NIK-247 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves scopolamine-induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement.
The findings suggest that NIK-247 may be a useful drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
