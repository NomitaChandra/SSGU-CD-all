Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortion.
Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described.
The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases.
Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches.
The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions.
The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases.
The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours.
If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.
