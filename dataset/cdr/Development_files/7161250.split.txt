Extrapyramidal side effects and oral haloperidol: an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics.
The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with haloperidol.
The incidence of parkinsonism was higher at higher doses of haloperidol and in younger patients.
Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients.
However, these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after parkinsonism developed.
Akathisia was controlled by the benzodiazepine lorazepam in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective.
The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to haloperidol.
