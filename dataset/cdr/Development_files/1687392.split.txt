Blockade of both D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors may induce catalepsy in mice.
1. The catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists has been tested and the possible dopamine subtypes involved in catalepsy was determined.
2.
Dopamine antagonist fluphenazine, D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 or D-2 antagonist sulpiride induced catalepsy.
The effect of fluphenazine and sulpiride was dose-dependent.
Combination of SCH 23390 with sulpiride did not induce catalepsy potentiation.
3.
D-1 agonist SKF 38393 or D-2 agonist quinpirole decreased the catalepsy induced by fluphenazine, SCH 23390 or sulpiride.
4.
Combination of SKF 38393 with quinpirole did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists.
5.
The data may indicate that although D-2 receptor blockade is involved in catalepsy, the D-1 receptor may plan a role.
