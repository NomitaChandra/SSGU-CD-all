Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patients .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients .
METHODS : This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation .
Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme - mediated immunoassay methodology .
Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng / mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng / mL were defined as positive .
Patient demographics , history of underlying drug or alcohol - related seizure disorder , estimated time from seizure to sample collection , history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse , results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers .
RESULTS : Fourteen of 248 ( 5 . 6 % , 95 % CI 2 . 7 % - 8 . 5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % CI 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for amphetamine .
Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : During this study period , routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield .
As a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population .
