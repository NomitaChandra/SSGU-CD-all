Hypotension , bradycardia , and asystole after high - dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient .
We report a case of hypotension , bradycardia , and asystole after intravenous administration of high - dose methylprednisolone in a 73 - year - old patient who underwent electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring throughout the episode .
There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier .
The patient was admitted with a pulmonary - renal syndrome with hemoptysis , rapidly progressive renal failure , and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit .
After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the patient recovered cardiac rhythm .
The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia .
This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP ) .
These mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event .
Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here , and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism .
