The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by streptozotocin - induced diabetes mellitus .
1 . The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in streptozotocin - diabetic rats were investigated .
2 .
Diabetes of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition ; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment .
3 .
Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation , ATP , and bethanechol .
4 .
Diabetes of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight , and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition , effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study .
5 .
Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation , ATP , and bethanechol .
6 .
The data indicate that the effects of streptozotocin - induced diabetes on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment .
