Amelioration of bendrofluazide - induced hypokalemia by timolol .
The beta adrenergic blocking drug , timolol , tended to correct the hypokalemia of short - term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant .
Timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following bendrofluazide and increased the urine sodium / potassium ratio .
There was no evidence of a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space .
