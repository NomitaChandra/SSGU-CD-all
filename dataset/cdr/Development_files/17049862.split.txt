Is phenytoin administration safe in a hypothermic child?
A male neonate with a Chiari malformation and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele.
During anaesthesia and surgery, he inadvertently became moderately hypothermic.
Intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis.
Following phenytoin administration, the patient developed acute severe bradycardia, refractory to atropine and adrenaline.
The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive.
Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children.
As phenytoin is a commonly used drug, clinicians need to be aware of this interaction.
