Effects of suprofen on the isolated perfused rat kidney .
Although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains unclear .
The direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell - free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg / dL of uric acid .
There were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion , oxygen consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug - free control groups .
In contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid ; no changes were found with suprofen in the absence of uric acid .
A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen , compared with drug - free controls .
However , the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period .
In summary , suprofen causes acute declines in renal function , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid .
