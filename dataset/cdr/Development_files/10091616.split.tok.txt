Worsening of levodopa - induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks .
Ten patients who had Parkinson 's disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation ) and motor ( flexion / extension of right fingers , flexion / extension of left fingers , flexion / extension of the neck , speaking aloud ) tasks on the worsening of peak - dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine .
Compared with the score at rest ( 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 ) , a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud ( 5 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 , p < 0 . 05 ) , movements of right ( 4 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) and left ( 3 . 7 + / - 0 . 8 , p < 0 . 05 ) fingers , movements of the neck ( 5 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) , and mental calculation ( 3 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) .
These results suggest that activation tasks such as " speaking aloud " could be used for objective assessment of dyskinesia severity .
