Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by ziprasidone on the second day of treatment .
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic - induced movement disorders .
We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) associated with the use of ziprasidone .
Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS , atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause .
The patient is a 24 - year - old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80 - mg / day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone .
This case is the earliest ( second day of treatment ) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature .
