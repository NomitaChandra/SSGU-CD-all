Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient : case report .
Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation .
However , adverse effects include cardiac toxicity .
Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation .
The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography .
Initially , allograft rejection was feared ; however , myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy ; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected .
The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time ; thus , tacrolimus dosage was reduced .
Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur , as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy .
Thus , we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy .
In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy , blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement .
