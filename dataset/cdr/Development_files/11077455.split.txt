Electro-oculography, electroretinography, visual evoked potentials, and multifocal electroretinography in patients with vigabatrin-attributed visual field constriction.
PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported.
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously.
Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin.
METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer.
Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken.
RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field.
The eighth exhibited concentric constriction.
Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave.
However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials.
Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.
CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy.
The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn.
