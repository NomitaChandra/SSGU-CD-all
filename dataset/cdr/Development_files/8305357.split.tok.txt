Liposomal daunorubicin in advanced Kaposi 's sarcoma : a phase II study .
We report a non - randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin ( DaunoXome ) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi 's sarcoma .
Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi 's sarcoma were entered in the trial .
Changes in size , colour and associated oedema of selected ' target ' lesions were measured .
Clinical , biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed .
Ten subjects were evaluated .
A partial response was achieved in four , of whom two subsequently relapsed .
Stabilization of Kaposi 's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six , maintained until the end of the trial period in four .
The drug was generally well tolerated , with few mild symptoms of toxicity .
The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity , with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0 . 5 x 10 ( 9 ) / l ) .
There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity .
In this small patient sample , liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi 's sarcoma .
