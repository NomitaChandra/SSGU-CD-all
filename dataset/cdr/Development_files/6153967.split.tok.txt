Epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation .
Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported .
In one patient , enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures .
Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified , the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants .
Two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication .
Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure - free .
Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG .
On the other hand , enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings .
