Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy : a complication associated with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .
Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy .
Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet - fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy , preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 per cubic millimeter .
The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin , and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications .
Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed .
The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin - induced platelet aggregation .
Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin , and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary .
Vascular procedures are performed as indicated .
