Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative ( SM - 5887 ) on normal heart and doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs .
This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM - 5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM - 5887 on low - grade cardiotoxicity pre - induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs .
In the chronic treatment , beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks , either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or SM - 5887 ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) .
The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing .
Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological cardiomyopathy , while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM - 5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG , blood pressure and histopathological examinations .
To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM - 5887 , low - grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) .
Nine weeks after pre - treatment , dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or SM - 5887 ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) once every 3 weeks .
The low - grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment .
On the contrary , the SM - 5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy .
In conclusion , SM - 5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in dogs .
