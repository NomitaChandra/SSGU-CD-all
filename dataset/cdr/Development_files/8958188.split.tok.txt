A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate lometrexol ( DDATHF ) given with oral folic acid .
Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis .
Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs , notably methotrexate .
However , the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities .
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration , i . e . for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose .
This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation .
Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities .
There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation .
Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance .
The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor .
This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy .
