Hepatic veno - occlusive disease caused by 6 - thioguanine .
Clinically reversible veno - occlusive disease of the liver developed in a 23 - year - old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia after 10 months of maintenance therapy with 6 - thioguanine .
Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement .
Although this disease was clinically reversible , some subintimal fibrosis about the terminal hepatic veins persisted .
This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible hepatic veno - occlusive disease over time , and may be the first case of veno - occlusive related solely to 6 - thioguanine .
