Assessment of perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire.
METHODS: Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother-infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire's 25 delivery hospitals.
Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, rubella immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women.
RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%) were high.
Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants.
All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin.
Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination.
The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest.
Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity (9.5%).
In-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women.
CONCLUSION: This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement.
