Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta - 2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers .
The metabolism of the cardioselective beta - blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine / sparteine type .
The two metabolic phenotypes , extensive ( EM ) and poor metabolizers ( PM ) , show different stereoselective metabolism , resulting in apparently higher beta - 1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs .
We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta - 2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol .
The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline - induced hypokalemia .
By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S - isomer , were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values , representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half - maximum receptor occupancy .
Six EMs received 0 . 5 mg of terbutaline s . c .
on two different occasions : 1 ) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2 ) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p . o .
Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol , except for a higher terbutaline dose ( 0 . 75 mg ) on day 2 .
Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium , terbutaline , metoprolol ( racemic , R - and S - isomer ) , and alpha - hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals , during 8 hr after metoprolol .
In PMs , metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs . time curve ( + 67 % ) .
Higher metoprolol / alpha - hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R - / S - isomer ratios of unchanged drug .
There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs ( 72 + / - 7 ng . ml - 1 ) than EMs ( 42 + / - 8 ng . ml - 1 , P less than . 001 ) . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) .
