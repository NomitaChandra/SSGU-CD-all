PTU - associated vasculitis in a girl with Turner Syndrome and Graves ' disease .
Palpable purpura is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes , including infectious and autoimmune processes .
A rare cause , drug - induced vasculitis , may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCAs ) in response to a medication .
We report a girl with Turner syndrome and Graves ' disease who presented with palpable purpuric lesions .
The diagnosis of propylthiouracil ( PTU ) - associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features , the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood , and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU .
Subsequent treatment of persistent hyperthyroidism with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the vasculitis , a complication described in prior case reports .
