Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of injury to different regions of the kidney .
Acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular , glomerular , and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hexachloro - 1 : 3 - butadiene ( HCBD ) , puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) , and 2 - bromoethylamine ( BEA ) , respectively .
Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity , the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase , and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine samples .
Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN .
The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion , especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40 , 000 Da .
In contrast , protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights .
Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity ) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes .
Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage .
It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage .
