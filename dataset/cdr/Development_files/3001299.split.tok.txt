Thyroid function and urine - concentrating ability during lithium treatment .
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment .
We measured serum thyroxine and urine - concentrating ability ( Umax ) in response to desmopressin ( DDAVP ) in 85 patients receiving lithium .
Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium .
Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well .
It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different .
