Transketolase abnormality in tolazamide - induced Wernicke 's encephalopathy .
We studied a thiamine - dependent enzyme , transketolase , from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke 's encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide , in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [ high Km for thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP ) ] , as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome .
In addition to this patient , we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kindreds without any history of Wernicke 's encephalopathy and from four normal controls .
We found that the above - mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke 's encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for TPP .
These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide - induced Wernicke 's encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality .
