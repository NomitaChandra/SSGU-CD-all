Beta - 2 - adrenoceptor - mediated hypokalemia and its abolishment by oxprenolol .
The time course and concentration - effect relationship of terbutaline - induced hypokalemia was studied , using computer - aided pharmacokinetic - dynamic modeling .
Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia , together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs .
Six healthy subjects were given a 0 . 5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions : 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg oxprenolol orally .
In the 7 - hour period after terbutaline administration , plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations .
The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects .
Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65 % and 56 % of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance , respectively , and an increase of 130 % of its AUC .
In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment , the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2 - blocking action .
