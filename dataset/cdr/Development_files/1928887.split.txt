Naloxone reversal of hypotension due to captopril overdose.
The hemodynamic effects of captopril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system.
The opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to block or reverse the hypotensive actions of captopril.
We report a case of an intentional captopril overdose, manifested by marked hypotension, that resolved promptly with the administration of naloxone.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of captopril-induced hypotension treated with naloxone.
Our experience demonstrates a possible role of naloxone in the reversal of hypotension resulting from captopril.
