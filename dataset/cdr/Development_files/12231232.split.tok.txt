The striatum as a target for anti - rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR1 , but not an agonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors .
The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 ( mGluR1 ) and group II mGluRs , localized in the striatum , are involved in antiparkinsonian - like effects in rats .
Haloperidol ( 1 mg / kg ip ) induced parkinsonian - like muscle rigidity , measured as an increased resistance of a rat 's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint .
( RS ) - 1 - aminoindan - 1 , 5 - dicarboxylic acid ( AIDA ; 0 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist , or ( 2R , 4R ) - 4 - aminopyrrolidine - 2 , 4 - dicarboxylate ( 2R , 4R - APDC ; 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a selective group II agonist , was injected bilaterally into the striatum of haloperidol - treated animals .
AIDA in doses of 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl diminished the haloperidol - induced muscle rigidity .
In contrast , 2R , 4R - APDC injections were ineffective .
The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1 , but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs , may ameliorate parkinsonian muscle rigidity .
