Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura .
Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase , thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception .
In recent years , increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide ( NO ) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura .
In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura , in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) ( 0 . 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min ) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura .
The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced .
Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls .
Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject .
Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion ( p = 0 . 037 ) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0 . 008 ) .
In the controls , the GTN - induced headache gradually disappeared , whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion .
At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society .
The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura .
Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals , this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura .
