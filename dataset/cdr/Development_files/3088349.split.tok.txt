Transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine .
Following unilateral 6 - OHDA induced SN lesion , a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling .
In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on amphetamine - induced rotational behavior .
Three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion .
Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool , or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons .
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation .
However , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , amphetamine dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine - induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections .
These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post - lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation .
