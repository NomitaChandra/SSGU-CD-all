Type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure: prevention with hepatitis B immune globulin.
Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study.
Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)-positive donors.
Clinical hepatitis developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001).
Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients.
Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (HBeAg; anti-HBE).
Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg-positive donors.
Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups.
The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.
