The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cases .
Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension , particularly when given as a bolus .
The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return .
Parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume .
Oxytocin - induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss .
Pulse power analysis ( also called " pulse contour analysis " ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure .
Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia .
Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume , heart rate and cardiac output .
Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia .
