Hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation .
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high - dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation .
As standard practice at our institution , patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation .
In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation , we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna , which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis .
Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis , 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis .
In contrast , two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks .
Because of this suboptimal result , we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis .
