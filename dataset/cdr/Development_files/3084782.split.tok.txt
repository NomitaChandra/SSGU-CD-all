Toxicity due to remission inducing drugs in rheumatoid arthritis .
Association with HLA - B35 and Cw4 antigens .
Twenty - five patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) who developed toxicity while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without toxicity were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens .
A strong association has been found between nephritis and dermatitis due to Tiopronin ( a D - Penicillamine like compound ) and class I antigens B35 - Cw4 , and between dermatitis due to gold thiosulphate and B35 .
Compared to healthy controls a lower DR5 frequency was observed in patients with RA except for the Tiopronin related nephritis group .
