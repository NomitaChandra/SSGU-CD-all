Succinylcholine-induced masseter muscle rigidity during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
Masseter muscle rigidity during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia.
The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of masseter muscle rigidity.
Here, we describe a case of severe masseter muscle rigidity (jaw of steel) after succinylcholine (Sch) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia.
