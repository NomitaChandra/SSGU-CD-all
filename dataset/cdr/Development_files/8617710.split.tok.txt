Absence of effect of sertraline on time - based sensitization of cognitive impairment with haloperidol .
This double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects .
METHOD : All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on Days 2 and 25 .
From Days 9 to 25 , subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline ( 12 subjects ) or placebo ( 12 subjects ) ; the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg / day from Days 9 to 16 , and remained at 200 mg / day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period .
Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24 - hour period after dosing on Days 1 , 2 , and 25 .
RESULTS : Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing .
When single - dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later , greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups , suggesting enhancement of this effect .
There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group .
Three subjects ( 2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo ) withdrew from the study because of side effects .
Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment .
The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar .
CONCLUSION : Haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration .
