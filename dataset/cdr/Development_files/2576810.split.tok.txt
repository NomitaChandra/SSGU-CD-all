Some central effects of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine .
We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine , a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and methoxamine and on the animal behavior in the " behavioral despair " test .
A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine ( twice daily for 14 days ) potentiated in mice and in rats ( weaker ) the amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .
The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine .
The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered methoxamine was not affected by repeated treatment with fluvoxamine .
Given three times fluvoxamine had no effect on the immobilization time in the " behavioral despair " test in rats .
The results indicate that fluvoxamine given repeatedly acts differently than citalopram , another selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , and differs also from other antidepressant drugs .
