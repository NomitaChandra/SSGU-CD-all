Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine catatonia in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals .
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine - induced catatonia in the intact , pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat .
In the pinealectomized chick , pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia ( DOC ) after ketamine , but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not .
The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions .
Serotonin and N - acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick .
Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so .
This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood - brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat .
In addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin .
Furthermore , dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary .
