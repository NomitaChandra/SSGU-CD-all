Thiazide diuretics , hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias .
Thiazide diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs .
Hypokalemia is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic thiazide therapy .
We treated 38 patients ( 22 low renin , 16 normal renin ) with moderate diastolic hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTC ) administered on a twice daily schedule .
Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg , 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized .
The serum K during the control period was 4 . 5 + / - 0 . 2 mEq / l an on 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 mg HCTZ daily 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 3 , 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 , 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 2 , and 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 mEq / l , respectively .
Corresponding figures for whole body K were 4107 + / - 208 , 3722 + / - 319 , 3628 + / - 257 , 3551 + / - 336 , and 3269 + / - 380 mEq , respectively .
In 13 patients we observed the effects of HCTZ therapy ( 100 mg daily ) on the occurrence of PVC 's during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise .
During rest we observed 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 08 PVC beats / min + / - SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 06 and 0 . 8 + / - 0 . 15 , respectively .
Corresponding figures during HCTZ therapy 100 mg daily were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 1 , 3 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 and 5 . 7 4 / - 0 . 8 , respectively .
The occurrence of PVC 's correlated significantly with the fall in serum K + observed r = 0 . 72 , p less than 0 . 001 .
In conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body potassium .
The more profound hypokalemia , the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC 's .
