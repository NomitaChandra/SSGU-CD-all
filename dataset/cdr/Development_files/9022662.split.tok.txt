Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis : case report and review of the literature .
BACKGROUND : Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder .
Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders .
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis .
CASE REPORT : Two , 3 - year - old male , identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59 tablets .
The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success .
This was their first day of pemoline therapy .
The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion .
The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders .
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements .
Despite treatment , the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours .
Forty - eight hours after admission , the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home .
CONCLUSION : Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature .
The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline overdose .
