Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl - induced muscular rigidity in the rat .
Whereas muscular rigidity is a well - known side effect that is associated with high - dose fentanyl anesthesia , a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism ( s ) .
We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon , using male Sprague - Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine .
Under proper control of respiration , body temperature and end - tidal CO2 , intravenous administration of fentanyl ( 50 or 100 micrograms / kg ) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles .
Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha - adrenoceptor blocker , prazosin .
Microinjection of fentanyl ( 2 . 5 micrograms / 50 nl ) directly into this pontine nucleus , on the other hand , elicited discernible electromyographic excitation .
It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons .
