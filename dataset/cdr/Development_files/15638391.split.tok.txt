Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental hyperprolactinemia induced by haloperidol .
The aim of the study was to examine the influence of hyperprolactinemia , induced by haloperidol ( HAL ) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe .
The study was performed on sexually mature male rats .
Serum concentrations of prolactin ( PRL ) and testosterone ( T ) were measured .
Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy .
Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti - Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen ( PCNA ) were performed .
In rats of the experimental group , the mean concentration of : PRL was more than twice higher , whereas T concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group .
Light microscopy visualized the following : hypertrophy and epithelium hyperplasia of the glandular ducts , associated with increased PCNA expression .
Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells , concerning organelles , engaged in protein synthesis and secretion .
