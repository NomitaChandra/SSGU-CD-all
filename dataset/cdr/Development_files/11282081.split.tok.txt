Effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs .
BACKGROUND : Atrial tachycardia - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and decreases L - type Ca ( 2 + ) current .
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L - type Ca ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote AF , consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca ( 2 + ) channel inhibition .
METHODS : To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered verapamil to morphine - chloralose anesthetized dogs .
Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments .
Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF .
RESULTS : Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / - S . E . ) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0 . 01 vs . control ) at a loading dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0 . 0005 vs . control ) at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg .
Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil .
In these experiments , verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0 . 02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1 % , P < 0 . 05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms , P < 0 . 005 ) .
Diltiazem did not affect ERP , AF cycle length or AF duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5 ) .
In the presence of autonomic blockade , verapamil failed to promote AF and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness .
Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade .
Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle .
CONCLUSIONS : Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem .
