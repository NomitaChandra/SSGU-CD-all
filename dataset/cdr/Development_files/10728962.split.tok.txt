The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension .
In patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone , low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone .
