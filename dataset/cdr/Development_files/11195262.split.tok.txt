Contribution of sodium valproate to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone .
We report the case of a 62 - year - old man who was administered sodium valproate ( VPA ) and who subsequently developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone ( SIADH ) .
He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic - clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old .
After substituting VPA with zonisamide , the serum sodium level returned to normal .
We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long - term administration of VPA .
