Prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids .
The long - term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents ( ND - NMBA ) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness , although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear .
We report 3 patients ( age 37 - 52 years ) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND - NMBAs .
Two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids .
Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients , and all had acidosis .
Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials , normal sensory studies , and fibrillations .
Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients .
The serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng / mL .
A muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick , myosin filaments .
The weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction ( most likely due to ND - NMBA ) and muscle ( most likely due to corticosteroids ) .
Hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors .
