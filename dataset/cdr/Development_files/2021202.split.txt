Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane-induced hypotension in humans.
The effect of isoflurane-induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, respectively.
Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane.
Hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg.
GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension.
Postoperatively, ERPF returned to preoperative values, whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values.
Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow.
We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.
