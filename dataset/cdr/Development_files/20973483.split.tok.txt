In vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A2A / A1 receptor antagonist in animal models of Parkinson 's disease .
The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A ( 2A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist in several animal models of Parkinson 's disease is described .
Discovery and scale - up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail , highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10 . 0 % to 30 . 5 % .
Compound 1 is a potent A ( 2A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist in vitro ( A ( 2A ) K ( i ) = 4 . 1 nM ; A ( 1 ) K ( i ) = 17 . 0 nM ) that has excellent activity , after oral administration , across a number of animal models of Parkinson 's disease including mouse and rat models of haloperidol - induced catalepsy , mouse model of reserpine - induced akinesia , rat 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) lesion model of drug - induced rotation , and MPTP - treated non - human primate model .
