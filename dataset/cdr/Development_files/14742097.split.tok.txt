A randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study of ephedrine for SSRI - induced female sexual dysfunction .
The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine , an alpha - and beta - adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women , has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant - induced sexual dysfunction .
Nineteen sexually dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine , sertraline , or paroxetine participated in an eight - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study of the effects of ephedrine ( 50 mg ) on self - report measures of sexual desire , arousal , orgasm , and sexual satisfaction .
Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity / pleasure on 50 mg ephedrine 1 - hr prior to sexual activity , significant improvements in these measures , as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo .
These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo - controlled trials for this condition .
