Effect of lithium maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function .
OBJECTIVES : To assess changes induced by lithium maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid , parathyroid and ion alterations .
These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy , age , sex , and family history ( whether or not the patient had a first - degree relative with thyroid disease ) .
DESIGN : Prospective study .
SETTING : Affective Disorders Clinic at St .
Mary 's Hospital , Montreal .
PATIENTS : One hundred and one patients ( 28 men and 73 women ) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year 's to 32 years ' duration .
The control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital 's out - patient clinics .
OUTCOME MEASURES : Laboratory analyses of calcium , magnesium and thyroid - stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at biannual follow - up .
RESULTS : Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients , excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline .
All patients having first - degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism ( 3 . 7 years after onset of lithium therapy ) compared with patients without a family history ( 8 . 6 years after onset of lithium therapy ) .
Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age ( 34 . 6 % versus 31 . 9 % ) .
Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels .
After lithium treatment , calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels .
Thus , lithium treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging .
CONCLUSIONS : Familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during lithium therapy .
