Involvement of the mu - opiate receptor in peripheral analgesia .
The intradermal injection of mu ( morphine , Tyr - D - Ala - Gly - NMe - Phe - Gly - ol and morphiceptin ) , kappa ( trans - 3 , 4 - dichloro - N - methyl - N [ 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexyl ] benzeneactemide ) and delta ( [ D - Pen2 . 5 ] - enkephalin and [ D - Ser2 ] - [ Leu ] enkephalin - Thr ) selective opioid - agonists , by themselves , did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat .
Intradermal injection of mu , but not delta or kappa opioid - agonists , however , produced dose - dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E2 - induced hyperalgesia .
The analgesic effect of the mu - agonist morphine was dose - dependently antagonized by naloxone and prevented by co - injection of pertussis toxin .
Morphine did not , however , alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8 - bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate .
We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu - opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system .
