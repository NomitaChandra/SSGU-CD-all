KF17837 : a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity .
KF17837 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist .
Oral administration of KF17837 ( 2 . 5 , 10 . 0 and 30 . 0 mg / kg ) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine A2A receptor agonist , CGS 21680 ( 10 micrograms ) , in a dose - dependent manner .
KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol ( 1 mg / kg i . p . ) and by reserpine ( 5 mg / kg i . p . ) .
These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0 . 625 and 2 . 5 mg / kg p . o . , respectively .
Moreover , KF17837 ( 0 . 625 mg / kg p . o . ) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L - DOPA ; 25 mg / kg i . p . ) plus benserazide ( 6 . 25 mg / kg i . p . ) .
These results suggested that KF17837 is a centrally active adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists .
Furthermore , KF17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism .
