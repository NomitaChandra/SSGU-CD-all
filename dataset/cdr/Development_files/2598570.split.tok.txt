The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen .
Suprofen , a new nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent .
Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system , 700 , 000 persons used the drug in the United States .
Through August 1986 , a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported .
To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome , a case - control study was performed , comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen - exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome .
Case patients were more likely to be men ( odds ratio , 3 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 2 - 12 . 1 ) , suffer from hay fever and asthma ( odds ratio , 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 0 - 11 . 9 ) ; to participate in regular exercise ( odds ratio , 5 . 9 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 30 . 7 ) , especially in the use of Nautilus equipment ( p = 0 . 02 ) ; and to use alcohol ( odds ratio , 4 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 17 . 5 ) .
Possible risk factors included young age , concurrent use of other analgesic agents ( especially ibuprofen ) , preexisting renal disease , a history of kidney stones , a history of gout , a recent increase in activity , a recent increase in sun exposure , and residence in the Sunbelt .
These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance .
These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome : acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules .
