Conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients : report of an initial experience .
BACKGROUND : The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine ( CsA ) or tacrolimus ( Tac ) toxicity .
METHODS : Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin ( RAPA ) ( 5 mg / day ) 0 to 204 months posttransplant .
Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses .
The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity ( 12 ) , acute CsA or Tac toxicity ( 3 ) , severe facial dysmorphism ( 2 ) , posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) in remission ( 2 ) , and hepatotoxicity in 1 .
Follow - up is 7 to 24 months .
RESULTS : In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 6 months ] .
Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients .
No relapse of PTLD was observed .
Five patients developed pneumonia ( two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate ) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans .
There were no deaths .
RAPA was discontinued in four patients , because of pneumonia in two , PTLD in one , and oral aphtous ulcers in one .
RAPA levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml ) in 7 of 13 ( 54 % ) patients .
CONCLUSIONS : RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal .
However , when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over - immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given .
