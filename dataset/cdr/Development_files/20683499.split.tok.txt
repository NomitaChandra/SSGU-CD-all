Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L . , crocin on streptozocin - induced model of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease in male rats .
BACKGROUND : The involvement of water - soluble carotenoids , crocins , as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L . extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed .
In the present study , the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer 's disease induced by intracerebroventricular ( icv ) streptozocin ( STZ ) in male rats was investigated .
METHODS : Male adult Wistar rats ( n = 90 and 260 - 290 g ) were divided into 1 , control ; 2 and 3 , crocins ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) ; 4 , STZ ; 5 and 6 , STZ + crocins ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) groups .
In Alzheimer 's disease groups , rats were injected with STZ - icv bilaterally ( 3 mg / kg ) in first day and 3 days later , a similar STZ - icv application was repeated .
In STZ + crocin animal groups , crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg / kg , i . p . , one day pre - surgery and continued for three weeks .
Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days .
However , the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm , and for spatial cognition evaluation , Y - maze task was used .
RESULTS : It was found out that crocin ( 30 mg / kg ) - treated STZ - injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y - maze than vehicle - treated STZ - injected rats .
In addition , crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ - injected group in passive avoidance test .
CONCLUSION : Therefore , these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin ( 30 mg / kg ) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ - icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease .
