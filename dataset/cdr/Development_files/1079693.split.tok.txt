Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years .
Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17 . 2 % ) developed iridocyclitis .
Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis .
However , 30 % of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age .
Although 61 % of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active uveitis on entry .
Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases .
Forty - four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , ocular pain , decreased visual acuity , or photophobia , in order of decreasing frequency .
Even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics .
Despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies .
Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respectively .
We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs .
Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found .
Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases .
This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously .
Surgical treatment of cataracts , band keratopathy , and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results .
