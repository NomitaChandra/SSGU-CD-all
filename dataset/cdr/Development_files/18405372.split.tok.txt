Hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis : A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events .
BACKGROUND : Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) are handicapped by under - reporting and limited detail on individual cases .
We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients .
METHODS : Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years .
Patients ' , who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR , were identified .
Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument .
The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions .
RESULTS : Ten cases were identified : eight occurred during surveillance .
Eight patients were hospitalised , two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant .
All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment .
Seven patients had a skin rash , three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis .
Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent .
Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six .
Drug - related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients .
The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0 . 4 % of treated patients .
CONCLUSION : Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under - appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .
