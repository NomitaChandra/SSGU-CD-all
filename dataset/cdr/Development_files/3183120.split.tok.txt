Reversible cerebral lesions associated with tiazofurin usage : MR demonstration .
Tiazofurin is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation .
We report our results with magnetic resonance ( MR ) in demonstrating reversible cerebral abnormalities concurrent with the use of this drug .
The abnormalities on MR were correlated with findings on CT as well as with cerebral angiography .
The utility of MR in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated .
