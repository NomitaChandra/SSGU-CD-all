Production of autochthonous prostate cancer in Lobund - Wistar rats by treatments with N - nitroso - N - methylurea and testosterone .
More than 50 % of Lobund - Wistar ( L - W ) strain rats developed large , palpable prostate adenocarcinomas ( PAs ) following treatments with N - nitroso - N - methylurea ( CAS : 684 - 93 - 5 ) and testosterone propionate [ ( TP ) CAS : 57 - 85 - 2 ] , and most of the tumor - bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions .
The incubation periods averaged 10 . 6 months .
Within the same timeframe , no L - W rat developed a similar palpable PA when treated only with TP .
In L - W rats , TP acted as a tumor enhancement agent , with primary emphasis on the development of prostate cancer .
