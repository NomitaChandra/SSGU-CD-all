Massive cerebral edema associated with fulminant hepatic failure in acetaminophen overdose: possible role of cranial decompression.
Cerebral edema may complicate the course of fulminant hepatic failure.
Response to conventional therapy has been disappointing.
We present a patient with fatal acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure, with signs and symptoms of cerebral edema, unresponsive to conventional medical therapy.
Cranial decompression was carried out.
A justification of the need for further evaluation of cranial decompression in such patients is presented.
