Persistent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus following lithium therapy .
We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic dehydration following a head injury .
Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus , and lithium therapy had been discontinued .
He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion , with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .
Lithium induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped .
We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .
