Anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in rats .
INTRODUCTION : The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones , namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin , were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex , weighing 150 - 200 g .
METHODS : The drugs were given orally , in doses of 50 mg / kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day .
The tests included open - field exploratory behaviour , elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze , social interaction and novelty - suppressed feeding latency behaviour .
RESULTS : The results indicate that ciprofloxacin - and norfloxacin - treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied .
However , ciprofloxacin - and norfloxacin - treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters .
CONCLUSION : The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin .
