Rosaceiform dermatitis associated with topical tacrolimus treatment .
We describe herein 3 patients who developed rosacea - like dermatitis eruptions while using 0 . 03 % or 0 . 1 % tacrolimus ointment for facial dermatitis .
Skin biopsy specimens showed telangiectasia and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis .
Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform dermatitis , although many cases have not been reported .
