Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin - associated intracerebral hemorrhage .
Warfarin - associated intracerebral hemorrhage ( W - ICH ) is a severe type of stroke .
There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W - ICH .
Using a mouse model , we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume .
Male CD - 1 mice were treated with warfarin ( 2 mg / kg over 24 h ) , resulting in a mean ( + / - s . d . ) International Normalized Ratio of 3 . 5 + / - 0 . 9 .
First , we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice .
Second , a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum .
Forty - five minutes later , the animals were randomly treated with PCC ( 100 U / kg ) or saline i . v .
( n = 12 per group ) .
Twenty - four hours after hemorrhage induction , hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay .
The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC - treated animals ( 6 . 5 + / - 3 . 1 microL ) compared with saline controls ( 15 . 3 + / - 11 . 2 microL , P = 0 . 015 ) .
In the saline group , 45 % of the mice developed large hematomas ( i . e . , > 15 microL ) .
In contrast , such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group .
We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W - ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume .
Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W - ICH .
