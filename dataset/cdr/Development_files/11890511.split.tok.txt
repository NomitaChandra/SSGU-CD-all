Erectile dysfunction occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat .
Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni - and bilateral injections of 6 - hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain .
Behavioral apomorphine - induced penile erections were reduced ( 5 / 8 ) and increased ( 3 / 8 ) in uni - and bilateral lesioned animals .
Intracavernous pressures , following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve , decreased in lesioned animals .
Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology .
Concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats .
Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in Parkinson 's disease .
