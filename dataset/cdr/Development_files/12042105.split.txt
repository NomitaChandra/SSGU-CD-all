Topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis.
Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures.
Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause metabolic acidosis in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.
In addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH.
These factors can lead to the development of calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis.
We report the first two cases of topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis in the urologic literature.
