Effect of captopril on pre - existing and aminonucleoside - induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats .
Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients .
The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR .
Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg / kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre - existing in SHR .
Also , captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR .
Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations , excretion of urine , sodium and potassium , endogenous creatinine clearance , body weight , and food and water consumption .
However , ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR .
