Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala - kindled rats .
Loreclezole ( 5 mg / kg ) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala - kindled rats , reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations .
The combinations of loreclezole ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) with valproate , clonazepam , or carbamazepine ( applied at their subprotective doses ) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test .
However , only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature .
Among several chemoconvulsants , bicuculline , N - methyl - D - aspartic acid and BAY k - 8644 ( the opener of L - type calcium channels ) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate .
On the other hand , bicuculline , aminophylline and BAY k - 8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam .
The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L - type of calcium channels .
