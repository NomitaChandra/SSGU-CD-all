Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors : general problem with substance specific differences ?
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction , stroke , hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors .
Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly , but not exclusively , in patients with concomitant risk factors .
Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal , vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention .
The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time .
A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance - specific differences , which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin - independent effects .
Diagnostic markers such as N - terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide ( NT - proBNP ) or high - sensitive C - reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk , thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity .
