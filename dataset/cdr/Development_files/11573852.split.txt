Amphotericin B-induced seizures in a patient with AIDS.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion.
CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time.
The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, hydrocortisone, and prochlorperazine.
Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration.
DISCUSSION: AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures.
The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures.
Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures.
However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out.
The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures.
To date, only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.
