Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syndrome .
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin - angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) .
In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) levels of angiotensinogen ( Ao ) were analyzed with the slot - blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues : kidney , heart , brain , and adrenal gland from control , nephrotic , and pair - fed ( PF ) rats .
NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino - nucleoside ( PAN ) .
Although a great urinary excretion and half - normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection , when NS was clearly established , hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change .
Furthermore , the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6 , nor did its hepatic levels at days 1 , 3 , 5 , or 7 after PAN injection .
These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN .
