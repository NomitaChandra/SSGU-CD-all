Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation.
BACKGROUND: Unfractionated heparin sodium (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%.
The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation.
We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3.
The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level.
HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14.
Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks.
RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively.
Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable.
In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively.
The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients.
The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14.
None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related HIT.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon.
