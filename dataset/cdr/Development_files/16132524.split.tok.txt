Intracavitary chemotherapy ( paclitaxel / carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases ) for recurrent glioblastoma - - clinical observations .
Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy .
Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers , separating two congruent networks of water channels .
Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs , the gel - like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity .
For human glioblastoma recurrences , the feasibility , safety , and short - term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study .
A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re - resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages .
Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain edema , while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg paclitaxel .
In the latter group , brain edema was markedly reduced and dealt medically .
Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma using cubic phases is feasible and safe , yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study .
