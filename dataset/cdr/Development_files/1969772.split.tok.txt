Preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs .
The introduction of drugs that could induce hypotension with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy .
Specific dopamine - 1 , ( DA1 ) and dopamine - 2 ( DA2 ) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation .
Fenoldopam mesylate is a specific DA1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation .
The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested .
Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively , in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia .
Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 + / - 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam ( 3 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) and 34 + / - 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside ( 5 . 9 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) ( NS ) .
Renal blood flow ( RBF ) increased during fenoldopam - induced hypotension 11 + / - 7 per cent and decreased 21 + / - 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside - induced hypotension ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
Sodium nitroprusside is a non - selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension .
Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine - 1 ( DA1 ) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced hypotension .
