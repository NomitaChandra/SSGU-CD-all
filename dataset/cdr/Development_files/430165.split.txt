Transient hemiparesis: a rare manifestation of diphenylhydantoin toxicity.
Report of two cases.
Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin (DPH) overdose, the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar dysfunction.
Very rarely, the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin.
Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose.
Both had brain surgery before DPH treatment.
It is assumed that patients with some cerebral damage are liable to manifest DPH toxicity as focal neurological signs.
