Case report : pentamidine and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia revisited .
Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias , including torsade de pointes .
This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date .
Pentamidine - induced torsade de pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade .
Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine .
In these patients , no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed .
Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early , possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine .
When QTc interval prolongation is observed , early magnesium supplementation is advocated .
