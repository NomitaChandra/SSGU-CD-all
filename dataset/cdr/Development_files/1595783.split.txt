Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis.
The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific.
The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as heart failure, infection, and malignancy.
While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable.
Dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients.
