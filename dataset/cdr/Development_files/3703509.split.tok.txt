Hyperglycemic acidotic coma and death in Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long - standing Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
Following short exposure to oral prednisone , both boys developed lethargy , increasing somnolence , polydipsia , polyphagia , and polyuria .
Both presented in the emergency room with profound coma , hypotension , severe hyperglycemia , and acidosis .
Nonketotic lactic acidosis was present in one and ketosis without a known serum lactate level was present in the other .
Respiratory failure rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation .
We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic metabolic - endocrine failure in the Kearns - Sayre syndrome .
