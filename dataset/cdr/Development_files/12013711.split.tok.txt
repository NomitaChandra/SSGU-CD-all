Risperidone - associated , benign transient visual disturbances in schizophrenic patients with a past history of LSD abuse .
Two schizophrenic patients , who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics , were successfully treated with risperidone .
They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances , which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone .
This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as " flashbacks " related to prior LSD consumption .
Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off .
During a six - month follow - up period , there was no recurrence of visual disturbances .
This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign , short - term and self - limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment .
Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution .
