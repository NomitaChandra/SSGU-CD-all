Venous complications of midazolam versus diazepam .
Although some studies have suggested fewer venous complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures , this variable has not been well documented .
We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy .
Overall , venous complications were more frequent with diazepam ( 22 of 62 patients ) than with midazolam ( 4 of 60 patients ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
A palpable venous cord was present in 23 % ( 14 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group , compared with 2 % ( 1 of 60 patients ) in the midazolam group ( p < 0 . 002 ) .
Pain at the injection site occurred in 35 % ( 22 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7 % ( 4 of 60 patients ) in the midazolam group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Swelling and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups .
Smoking , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug use , intravenous catheter site , dwell time of the needle , alcohol use , and pain during the injection had no effect on the incidence of venous complications .
