Long - term efficacy and toxicity of high - dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation .
Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained , symptomatic ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ( n = 118 ) or a cardiac arrest ( n = 36 ) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs .
The loading dose was 800 mg / day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg / day .
Sixty - nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) over a follow - up of 6 to 52 months ( mean + / - standard deviation 14 . 2 + / - 8 . 2 ) .
Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug .
One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51 % of patients .
Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41 % and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10 % of patients .
The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia ( 35 % ) , nausea and anorexia ( 8 % ) , visual halos or blurring ( 6 % ) , thyroid function abnormalities ( 6 % ) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates ( 5 % ) .
Although large - dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long - term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs , it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50 % of patients .
However , when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects , 75 % of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with amiodarone .
