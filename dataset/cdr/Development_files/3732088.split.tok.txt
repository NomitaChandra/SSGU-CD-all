Diuretics , potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease .
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias .
If this were so , patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible .
Thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium - conserving diuretic ( amiloride ) and a similar period on a potassium - losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) in a randomised study .
Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy .
Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens .
Compared to amiloride treatment , the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring ) and a higher Lown grading , increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation .
The above results indicate that because potassium - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease , even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients .
