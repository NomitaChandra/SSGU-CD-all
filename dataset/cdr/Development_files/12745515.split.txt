Seizure associated with sleep deprivation and sustained-release bupropion.
This case report describes a generalized seizure associated with sustained-release bupropion use and sleep deprivation.
The subject, a 31-year-old female smoker, was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained-release bupropion as an active control.
After 5 weeks of bupropion use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence.
The patient had no other risk factors for seizures.
We suggest that sleep deprivation may add to the risk of bupropion-associated seizures.
