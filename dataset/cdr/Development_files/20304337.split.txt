Brainstem dysgenesis in an infant prenatally exposed to cocaine.
Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal cocaine abuse during pregnancy.
Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of fetal anomalies.
We report on an infant with multiple cranial-nerve involvement attributable to brainstem dysgenesis, born to a cocaine-addicted mother.
