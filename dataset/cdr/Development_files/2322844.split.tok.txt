Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of prostaglandin D2 , E2 , or F2 alpha to conscious mice .
The effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests .
Prostaglandin D2 ( 0 . 5 - 3 ng / mouse ) had a hyperalgesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3 - 60 min period after injection .
Prostaglandin E2 showed a hyperalgesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng / mouse , but the effect lasted shorter ( 3 - 30 min ) than that of prostaglandin D2 .
Similar results were obtained by acetic acid writhing tests .
The hyperalgesic effect of prostaglandin D2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist ( greater than or equal to 100 ng ) but not by AH6809 , a prostanoid EP1 - receptor antagonist .
Conversely , prostaglandin E2 - induced hyperalgesia was blocked by AH6809 ( greater than or equal to 500 ng ) but not by the substance P antagonist .
Prostaglandin F2 alpha had little effect on pain responses .
These results demonstrate that both prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 exert hyperalgesia in the spinal cord , but in different ways .
