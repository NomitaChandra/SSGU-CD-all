Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol .
Among various oral antiplatelets , a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost ( BPT ) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol ( CLZ ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP ( cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate ) .
Thereby , a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted .
Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT / CLZ in the following schedule ; BPT : 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t . i . d .
from day 7 to 14 , CLZ : 200 mg t . i . d .
from day 3 to 14 .
At various time intervals , physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed .
Throughout the observation period , no significant alteration in vital signs was observed .
Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one , especially after ingestion of CLZ .
All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required .
Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / - 4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / - 2 . 25 pmol ) .
The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted .
In conclusion , the combined administration of BPT / CLZ is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated .
