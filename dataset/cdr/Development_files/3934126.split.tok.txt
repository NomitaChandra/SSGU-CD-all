A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy .
A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16 - month period .
Vancomycin was curative in 95 % of 43 patients with proven infection .
Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions ; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause .
Reactions included thrombophlebitis ( 20 of 54 patients ) , rash ( 4 of 54 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 4 of 50 ) , proteinuria ( 1 of 50 ) and ototoxicity ( 1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry ) .
Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae ; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin .
We conclude that vancomycin , administered appropriately , constitutes safe , effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria .
