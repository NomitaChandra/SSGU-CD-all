Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with antecedent tamoxifen use.
BACKGROUND: Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen.
Review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumors.
CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma.
Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of tamoxifen use.
After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases, the patient was found to have a stage Ic granulosa cell tumor of the ovary.
CONCLUSION: Patients with tamoxifen-induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in tamoxifen metabolism.
