Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine.
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature.
We describe a 5th case.
The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine.
Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole.
The patients have all regained some degree of renal function.
However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement.
Quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized.
It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.
