Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic - induced parkinsonism .
In a 12 - week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients .
Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine , their previous antiparkinsonian drug .
However , benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment , and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients .
This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic - induced parkinsonian symptoms , because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect .
