Reversal of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy by novel aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drugs.
The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol.
A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy.
Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy.
Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective.
However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.
