Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol : case report and review of the literature .
CASE : A 49 - year - old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing .
On electrocardiogram , episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 - hour Holter monitoring recorded several events .
The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol , but recurred a year later .
The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol .
After stopping the beta - agonist , and after a week with the atenolol , the arrhythmia disappeared .
DISCUSSION : Swallowing - induced atrial tachyarrhythmia ( SIAT ) is a rare phenomenon .
Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature .
This article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT .
It discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia , postulated mechanisms of SIAT , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) .
CONCLUSION : Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT .
Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it .
