Cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer - - a highly aggressive disease : analysis of 12 cases .
PURPOSE : We gained knowledge of the etiology , treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The medical records of 6 men and 6 women ( mean age 55 years ) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed .
RESULTS : All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma .
Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease .
Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months .
The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later .
CONCLUSIONS : Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease .
However , long - term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease , even when noninvasive .
