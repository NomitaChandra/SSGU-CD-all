Recurrent dysosmia induced by pyrazinamide.
Pyrazinamide can have adverse effects such as hepatic toxicity, hyperuricemia or digestive disorders.
In rare cases, alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for pyrazinamide when combined with other drugs.
We report a case of reversible olfactory disorder related to pyrazinamide in a woman, with a positive rechallenge.
The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake.
Dysosmia disappeared completely after pyrazinamide withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge.
The case was reported to the Tunisian Centre of Pharmacovigilance.
