Epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces SLE ( folic acid and epilepsy )
OBJECTIVE : To study the effect of folic acid - containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy - related side effects .
STUDY DESIGN : First a randomised trial , later periconception care including in total 12225 females .
RESULTS : Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid ( 0 . 8 mg ) - containing multivitamin supplementation , no one developed epilepsy - related side effects during the periconception period .
One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate .
Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin .
This 22 - year - old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid ( 1 mg ) - containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation .
She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes .
Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth .
CONCLUSIONS : The epileptic pregnant patient 's autoimmune disease ( probably drug - induced lupus ) could damage the blood - brain barrier , therefore the therapeutic dose ( > or = 1 mg ) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures .
Physiological dose ( < 1 mg ) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women , all without any autoimmune disease , did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures .
