Metformin prevents experimental gentamicin - induced nephropathy by a mitochondria - dependent pathway .
The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients .
Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity .
Mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive oxygen species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration .
Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin - mediated acute renal failure .
This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems .
Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration .
These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function .
We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , NADH ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores .
These injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by metformin .
Thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis .
