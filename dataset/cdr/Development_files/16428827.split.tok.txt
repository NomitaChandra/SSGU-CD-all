Daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase from MC - IXC cells and improves drug - induced amnesia .
The choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) activator , which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine ( ACh ) , is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect ( 46 % ) on ChAT in vitro .
Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana , the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein ( 4 ' , 7 - dihydroxy - isoflavone ) .
In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine - induced impairments of learning and memory , we conducted a series of in vivo tests .
Administration of daidzein ( 4 . 5 mg / kg body weight ) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine - induced amnesia , according to the results of a Y - maze test .
Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y - maze tests ( a 37 % decreases in alternation behavior ) .
By way of contrast , mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment ( an approximately 12 % - 21 % decrease in alternation behavior ) .
These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator , and that it also ameliorates scopolamine - induced amnesia .
