Anti - carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat .
The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital ( PB : 15 mg per rat of ingested dose ) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine ( DEN : 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Wistar rats ( 180 g ) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2 , 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis .
After the end of the treatment , the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks .
The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats .
When the treatment last only 2 weeks , the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters .
In DEN + PB treated rats , the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone .
It is concluded that PB , which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment , reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN .
This ' anti - carcinogen ' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions .
Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this ' paradoxical ' PB effect .
