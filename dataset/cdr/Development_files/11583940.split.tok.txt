Sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin - free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
Calcineurin inhibitors , such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus , have been available for almost 20 years .
Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression , they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity .
Acute nephrotoxicity , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss .
Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases .
Two recently available immunosuppressive agents , mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( rapamycin ) , have no nephrotoxicity .
The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy .
This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
