Valproic acid I : time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers , liver toxicity , and valproic acid metabolite levels in rats .
A single dose of valproic acid ( VPA ) , which is a widely used antiepileptic drug , is associated with oxidative stress in rats , as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - isoprostane ( 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP ) .
To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA - associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity , adult male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA ( 500 mg / kg ) or 0 . 9 % saline ( vehicle ) once daily for 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , or 14 days .
Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP , lipid hydroperoxides ( LPO ) , and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARs ) .
Plasma and liver 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control .
Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment ( 1 . 8 - fold versus control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days ( 2 - fold vs . control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha - glutathione S - transferase ( alpha - GST ) and by histology .
Serum alpha - GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4 , which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule , necrosis , and steatosis throughout the study .
The liver levels of beta - oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14 , while the levels of 4 - ene - VPA and ( E ) - 2 , 4 - diene - VPA were not elevated throughout the study .
Overall , these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress , as measured by levels of 15 - F ( 2t ) - IsoP , which precedes the onset of necrosis , steatosis , and elevated levels of serum alpha - GST .
