Nicotine potentiation of morphine-induced catalepsy in mice.
In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated.
Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy.
The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine.
Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine.
Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine.
Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine.
It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.
