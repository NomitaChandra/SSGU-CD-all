Pallidal stimulation : an alternative to pallidotomy ?
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985 .
Laitinen 's procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant PD , which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community .
Another lesioning procedure , ventrolateral thalamotomy , has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius , producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates .
Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success .
According to the literature pallidotomy improves the " on " symptoms of PD , such as dyskinesias , as well as the " off " symptoms , such as rigidity , bradykinesia , and on - off fluctuations .
Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent ; however , its strength seems to be in improving levodopa - induced dyskinesias .
Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper - or dyskinetic upper limbs , but increases the " freezing " phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time .
Considering the small increase in the patient 's independence , the high costs of bilateral implants , and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices , the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy .
