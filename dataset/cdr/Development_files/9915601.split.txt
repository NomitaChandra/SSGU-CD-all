Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid.
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane.
Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol.
Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised.
These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone.
Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.
