Immunopathology of penicillamine - induced glomerular disease .
Four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with D - penicillamine .
Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase , or no departure from normal .
Electron microscopy , however , revealed subepithelial electron - dense deposits , fusion of epithelial cell foot processes , and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity .
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3 .
The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis , differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early - acting complement components C1q and C4 .
It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway .
