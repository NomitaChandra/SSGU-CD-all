Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's effects.
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: Community hospital.
PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects.
INTERVENTION: Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol.
Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg.
Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control.
Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control.
Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control.
No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon.
CONCLUSION: During dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia.
Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.
