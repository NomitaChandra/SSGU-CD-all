Quantitative drug levels in stimulant psychosis : relationship to symptom severity , catecholamines and hyperkinesia .
To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels , catecholamines , and psychotic symptoms , nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine - or cocaine - induced psychosis were interviewed , and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels .
Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating .
HVA levels were related to global hyperkinesia but not to psychopathology ratings .
Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role , intensity of stimulant - induced psychotic symptoms and stereotypies appears to be at least in part dose - related .
