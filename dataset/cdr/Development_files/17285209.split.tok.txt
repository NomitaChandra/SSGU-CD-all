Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor - associated angioedema of the stomach and small intestine : a case report .
This is a case report on a 45 - year old African - American female with newly diagnosed hypertension , who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine / benazapril 10 / 5 mg .
The very next day , she presented at the emergency room ( ER ) with abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting .
Physical exam , complete metabolic panel , and hemogram were in the normal range .
She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics .
However , she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints .
This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion .
CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach , duodenum and jejunum , along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) - induced angioedema was suspected , and anti - hypertensive medications were discontinued .
Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours , and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of ascites .
The recognition of angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) and angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) intestinal angioedema constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians , internists , emergency room personal and surgeons .
