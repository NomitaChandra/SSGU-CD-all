High - dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury .
Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies ( NASCIS ) , high - dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury .
In the NASCIS , there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high - dose methylprednisolone may cause .
The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition .
We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients .
Further , steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy , instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury .
To our knowledge , this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy .
