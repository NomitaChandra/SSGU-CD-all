Intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis treated with fluocinolone acetonide implants .
OBJECTIVE : To report the incidence and management of elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients with uveitis treated with the fluocinolone acetonide ( FA ) intravitreal implant .
DESIGN : Pooled data from 3 multicenter , double - masked , randomized , controlled , phase 2b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0 . 59 - mg or 2 . 1 - mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed .
RESULTS : During the 3 - year follow - up , 71 . 0 % of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55 . 1 % , 24 . 7 % , and 6 . 2 % of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more , 40 mm Hg or more , and 50 mm Hg or more , respectively .
Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74 . 8 % of implanted eyes , and IOP - lowering surgeries , most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76 . 2 % ) , were performed on 36 . 6 % of implanted eyes .
Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication ) in 85 . 1 % of eyes at 1 year .
The rate of hypotony ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg ) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( P = . 09 ) .
CONCLUSION : Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery .
