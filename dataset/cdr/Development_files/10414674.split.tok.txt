Effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) with prominent anti - inflammatory properties .
Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate .
Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen , 100 mg , three times a day ( ketoprofen group , n = 9 ) or a weak NSAID , acetaminophen , 1 g , three times a day ( acetaminophen group , n = 9 ) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH .
Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively .
Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first , third , and fifth postoperative mornings .
Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen .
Aggregation was lower ( P < . 05 ) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day .
In contrast , maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results ( P < . 05 ) .
One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma .
Coagulation ( prothrombin time [ PT ] , activated partial thromboplastin time [ APPT ] , fibrinogen concentration , and antithrombin III [ AT III ] ) was comparable between the two groups .
Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH .
If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms , it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage .
