Rapid reversal of life-threatening diltiazem-induced tetany with calcium chloride.
We describe a patient who developed tetany with sudden respiratory arrest after the infusion of intravenous diltiazem.
The administration of calcium chloride rapidly resolved the patient's tetany with prompt recovery of respiratory function, averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support.
The emergency physician should be aware that life-threatening tetany may accompany the administration of intravenous diltiazem and that calcium chloride may be a rapid and effective remedy.
