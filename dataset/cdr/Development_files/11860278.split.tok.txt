Dopamine D2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs .
Dopamine ( DA ) , through D1 / D2 receptor - mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system .
Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level .
In this respect , little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy - induced neuronal cell death .
Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine .
We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( KA ) , a potent glutamate agonist .
Importantly , D2R - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity .
However , pilocarpine - induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R - / - brains in comparison to KA .
Thus , the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine .
Moreover , the dopaminergic control of epilepsy - induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters .
