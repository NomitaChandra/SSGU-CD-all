Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine : potentiation , antagonism , tolerance and cross - tolerance in the rat .
Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat .
Pre - treatment with ketamine produced cross - tolerance to morphine , whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross - tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response ; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain .
The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , administered simultaneously .
There was mutual potentiation between sub - effective doses of ketamine and morphine , but sub - effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully - effective doses of morphine .
Latency to the loss of righting reflex , rigidity and behavior on recovery , reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination .
Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects .
The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub - effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar .
Rats , tolerant to ketamine - dominant combinations , were cross - tolerant to both drugs , while those tolerant to morphine - dominant combinations were cross - tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross - tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine .
While the mutual potentiation , antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy , differences in latency , rigidity and behavior , asymmetry of cross - tolerance and a widely - different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site .
