Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental isoniazid neuropathy in the rat .
The neuropathy caused by a single dose of isoniazid in rats was studied with a computer - assisted morphometric method .
Scatter diagrams of the g ratio ( quotient fibre diameter / axon diameter ) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population , distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre .
There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population , causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath .
