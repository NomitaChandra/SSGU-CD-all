Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine - induced amnesia in adult male rats .
The effect of ritanserin ( 5 - HT2 antagonist ) on scopolamine ( muscarinic cholinergic antagonist ) - induced amnesia in Morris water maze ( MWM ) was investigated .
Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus .
One week later , they received repeatedly vehicles ( saline , DMSO , saline + DMSO ) , scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl saline / side ; 30 min before training ) , ritanserin ( 2 , 4 and 8 microg / 0 . 5 microl DMSO / side ; 20 min before training ) and scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl ; 30 min before ritanserin injection ) + ritanserin ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl DMSO ) through cannulae each day .
Animals were tested for four consecutive days ( 4 trial / day ) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged .
In the fifth day , the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor , motivational and visual systems .
The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine - treated group as compared to saline group .
Ritanserin - treated rats ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl / side ) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO - treated group .
However , scopolamine and ritanserin co - administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine - treated rats .
Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine - induced amnesia .
