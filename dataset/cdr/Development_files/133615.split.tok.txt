Thromboembolic and other complications of oral contraceptive therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of blood coagulation factors : summary report of a ten - year study .
During a ten - year period , 348 women were studied for a total of 5 , 877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters .
Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems ( factors I , II , VII , VIII , IX , and X and plasminogen ) were observed in the treated groups .
Severe complications developed in four patients .
All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile , suggesting " hypercoagulability " before initiation of therapy .
Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients ; some increased further during therapy .
One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication , shortly after the base - line values were obtained .
One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy , and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy .
The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy .
All four patients were of the A or AB blood group .
Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen .
It appears from these data that hematologic work - ups may be useful in women who are about to start long - term oral contraceptive therapy .
