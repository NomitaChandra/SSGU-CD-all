A measure of pupillary oscillation as a marker of cocaine-induced paranoia.
Cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP) remains an important drug-induced model of idiopathic paranoia for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged.
Measures of pupillary oscillation were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent crack cocaine abusers endorsing past CIP (n = 32) from another group of crack addicts who denied past CIP (n = 29).
