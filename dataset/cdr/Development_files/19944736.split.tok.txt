A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB .
The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) and / or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound .
A Tween 80 - coated poly - L - lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system , able to trespass the BBB .
Tacrine , administered in LiCl pre - treated rats , induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage .
The toxic effects of tacrine - loaded poly - L - lactid acid nanoparticles ( 5mg / kg ) , a saline solution of tacrine ( 5mg / kg ) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i . p .
administration in LiCl - pre - treated Wistar rats .
All the animals treated with tacrine - loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms , i . e . epileptic onset , with respect to those animals treated with the free compound ( 10 min vs . 22 min respectively ) .
In addition , tacrine - loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals , while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60 % of animals .
Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control ( saline - treated ) group of animals .
In conclusion , the evaluation of time - to - onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine - lithium model of epilepsy in the rat , could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass ( or not ) the BBB in vivo .
