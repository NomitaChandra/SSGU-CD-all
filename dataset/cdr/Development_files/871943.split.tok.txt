The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea .
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase .
Adequate spontaneous respiration was re - established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection .
In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase .
In three patients none of the usual variants were found .
It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which can not hydrolyze succinylcholine .
The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist .
