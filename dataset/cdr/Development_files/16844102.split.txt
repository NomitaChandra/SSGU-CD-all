Effect of alpha-tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
Methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals.
This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity.
Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections).
The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration.
The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment.
alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity.
The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats.
These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO.
This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.
