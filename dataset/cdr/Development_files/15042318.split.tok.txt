Atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B - cell gastric lymphoma in a patient with myotonic dystrophy ( Steinert 's disease ) .
The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B - cell gastric lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy , the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy , and sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle of doxorubicin - based chemotherapy in the same patient .
Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy .
The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient .
