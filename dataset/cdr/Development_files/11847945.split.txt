Acute cholestatic hepatitis after exposure to isoflurane.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane.
CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia.
There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis.
No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia.
The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U/L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg/dL.
There was slow improvement over 4 months.
Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful.
DISCUSSION: The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis, which has a significant mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis.
