Acute renal failure in high dose carboplatin chemotherapy.
Carboplatin has been reported to cause acute renal failure when administered in high doses to adult patients.
We report a 4 1/2-year-old girl who was treated with high-dose carboplatin for metastatic parameningeal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
Acute renal failure developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function.
Possible contributing factors are discussed.
