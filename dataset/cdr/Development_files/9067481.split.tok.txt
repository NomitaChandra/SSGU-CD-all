Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen , adriamycin , carbon tetrachloride , chloroform and galactosamine .
In addition to its use as a stabilizer / rigidifier of membranes , cholesteryl hemisuccinate , tris salt ( CS ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) .
To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non - hydrolyzable ether form of CS , gamma - cholesteryloxybutyric acid , tris salt ( CSE ) against acetaminophen - , adriamycin - , carbon tetrachloride - , chloroform - and galactosamine - induced toxicity .
The results of these studies demonstrated that CS - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical .
A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS ( 100mg / kg , i . p . ) , resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4 , CHCl3 , acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardiotoxic ) effect of adriamycin administration .
Maximal CS - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult .
These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death .
The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity ) .
However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation .
Our findings do suggest that CS - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule ( non - hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .
