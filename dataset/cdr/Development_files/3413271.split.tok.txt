Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine : comparison with exercise - induced ischemia .
The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease .
Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise .
Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina .
However , the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise .
Exercise - induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate - pressure product with a minor contribution of end - diastolic volume , while epinephrine - induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate - pressure product .
These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .
