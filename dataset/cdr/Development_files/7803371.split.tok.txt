Cognitive deterioration from long - term abuse of dextromethorphan : a case report .
Dextromethorphan ( DM ) , the dextrorotatory isomer of 3 - hydroxy - N - methylmorphinan , is the main ingredient in a number of widely available , over - the - counter antitussives .
Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968 ) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability .
Subsequently , however , several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature .
The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects , ranging from nausea , restlessness , insomnia , ataxia , slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes , perceptual alterations , inattention , disorientation and aggressive behavior ( Rammer et al 1988 ; Katona and Watson 1986 ; Isbell and Fraser 1953 ; Devlin et al 1985 ; McCarthy 1971 ; Dodds and Revai 1967 ; Degkwitz 1964 ; Hildebrand et al 1989 ) .
There have also been two reported fatalities from DM overdoses ( Fleming 1986 ) .
However , there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse .
This report describes a case of cognitive deterioration resulting from prolonged use of DM .
