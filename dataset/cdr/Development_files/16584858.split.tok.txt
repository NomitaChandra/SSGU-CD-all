Role of mangiferin on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .
The current study dealt with the protective role of mangiferin , a polyphenol from Mangifera indica Linn .
( Anacardiaceae ) , on isoproterenol ( ISPH ) - induced myocardial infarction ( MI ) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism .
Subcutaneous injection of ISPH ( 200 mg / kg body weight in 1 ml saline ) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart , which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes ( CK - MB ) , increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity .
The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium .
The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities , non - enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin , Vitamin C , Vitamin E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats .
Upon pretreatment with mangiferin ( 100 mg / kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide ) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above - mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels .
Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non - enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH - induced MI rats .
From the present study it is concluded that mangiferin exerts a beneficial effect against ISPH - induced MI due to its antioxidant potential , which regulated the tissues defense system against cardiac damage .
