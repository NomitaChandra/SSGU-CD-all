A dystonia - like syndrome after neuropeptide ( MSH / ACTH ) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus .
The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia , and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit .
The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE - mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway .
However , it is not certain as to the following : ( a ) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N - terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder ; ( b ) whether NE , released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway , did indeed cause the long - term depression at Purkinje cell synapses ( previously described by others ) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder ; ( c ) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei , the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons , that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder .
These questions are currently being investigated .
