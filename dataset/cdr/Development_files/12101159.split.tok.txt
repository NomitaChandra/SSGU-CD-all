Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose ; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium .
A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1 . 8 - 3 . 6 g of diltiazem , paracetamol , aspirin , isosorbide nitrate , and alcohol .
He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids .
Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic - clonic seizures .
The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia , unrecordable blood pressure , and then became asystolic .
He was resuscitated with high dose ( 13 . 5 g ) intravenous calcium and adrenaline ( epinephrine ) .
He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours .
This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose , particularly with the onset of asystole .
It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose .
The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered .
