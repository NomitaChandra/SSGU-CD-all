Seizure activity with imipenem therapy: incidence and risk factors.
Two elderly patients with a history of either cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or head trauma and no evidence of renal disease developed seizures while receiving maximum doses of imipenem/cilastatin.
Neither patient had reported previous seizures or seizure-like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents.
All seizures were controlled with therapeutic doses of phenytoin.
Both patients had received maximum doses of other beta-lactam antibiotics without evidence of seizure activity.
