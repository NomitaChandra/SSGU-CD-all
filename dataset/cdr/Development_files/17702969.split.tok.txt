Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces fetal pulmonary hypertension in the rat .
RATIONALE : Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women .
Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome of the newborn .
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate .
METHODS : Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine ( 10 mg / kg ) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section .
As compared with controls , fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum ( P = 0 . 02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals , and arterial oxygen saturation was 96 + / - 1 % in 1 - day - old control animals and significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) in fluoxetine - exposed pups ( 79 + / - 2 % ) .
In vitro , fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal , but not adult , animals ( P < 0 . 01 ) and reduced serotonin - induced contraction at both ages ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
After in utero exposure to a low fluoxetine concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal , but not adult , cells ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the adult , fluoxetine exposure in utero induces pulmonary hypertension in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation .
