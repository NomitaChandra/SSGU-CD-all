Cholestatic jaundice associated with the use of metformin.
We report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride.
Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal.
An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy.
A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis, with portal edema, ductular proliferation, and acute inflammation.
Metformin hydrochloride was discontinued, and the patient's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months.
Given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin, we believe that this case represents an example of metformin-associated hepatotoxicity, the first such case reported.
