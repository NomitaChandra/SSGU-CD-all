Minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after dexamethasone treatment in very-low birth-weight infants.
The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very-low-birthweight infants.
Thirty-three children after dexamethasone treatment were matched to 33 children without dexamethasone treatment.
Data were assessed at the age of 3-7 years.
Dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day.
Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, malformations, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation.
Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw-a-Man Test.
There were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups.
Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01).
In the Draw-a-Man Test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001).
There were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children.
After dexamethasone treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions.
Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis.
Further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on neurological and cognitive development.
