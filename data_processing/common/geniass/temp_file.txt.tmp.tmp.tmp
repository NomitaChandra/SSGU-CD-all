rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease.
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear.__0____ __Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)__1____ __over the supplementary motor area (SMA)__2____ __in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion.__3____ __rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5-Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.
