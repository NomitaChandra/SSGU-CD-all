Availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation.
Field potential duration (FPD)__0____ __in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram, is reported to be a useful tool to predict K(+)__1____ __channel and Ca(2+)__2____ __channel blocker effects on QT interval.__3____ __However, there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for QT prolongation.__4____ __The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA (Multielectrode array)__5____ __of hiPS-CMs can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers.__6____ __hiPS-CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration.__7____ __IKr and IKs blockers concentration-dependently prolonged corrected FPD (FPDc), whereas Ca(2+)__8____ __channel blockers concentration-dependently shortened FPDc.__9____ __Also, the multichannel blockers Amiodarone, Paroxetine, Terfenadine and Citalopram prolonged FPDc in a concentration dependent manner.__10____ __Finally, the IKr blockers, Terfenadine and Citalopram, which are reported to cause Torsade de Pointes (TdP)__11____ __in clinical practice, produced early afterdepolarization (EAD).__12____ __hiPS-CMs using MEA system and FPDc can predict the effects of drug candidates on QT interval.__13____ __This study also shows that this assay can help detect EAD for drugs with TdP potential.
