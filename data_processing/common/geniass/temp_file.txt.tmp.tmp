Glycopyrronium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of edrophonium.
We have compared, in 60 adult patients, the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 and 10 micrograms kg-1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg-1.__0____ __Significant differences between the four groups were detected (P less than 0.001).__1____ __Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg-1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min-1 (95% confidence limits 28-32 beat min-1).__2____ __Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the edrophonium, was sufficient to minimize early, edrophonium-induced bradycardias.__3____ __This low dose of glycopyrronium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions.
